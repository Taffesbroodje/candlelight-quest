description = "A stark, dramatic landscape of blackened volcanic rock and steaming vents, where the mining town of Cinderhold clings to the slopes of a dormant volcano. Rich veins of ore and obsidian draw hardy miners and ambitious smiths, but the deep tunnels harbor dangers far worse than cave-ins. The air tastes of sulfur, and the ground trembles with the mountain's restless dreams."
