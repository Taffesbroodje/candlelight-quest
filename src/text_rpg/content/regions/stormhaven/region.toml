description = "A weathered coastal town built around a natural harbor battered by frequent storms. Stormhaven is a hub for deep-sea fishing, whaling, and trade, where the Harpooner's Guild competes with privateers for control of the waters. Salt-crusted buildings cling to the cliffsides above crashing waves."
