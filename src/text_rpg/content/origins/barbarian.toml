prologue = """
The Ashen Highlands bred you hard. Your clan, the Cindermaw, claimed the volcanic \
ridges where the air tastes of sulfur and the ground sometimes bleeds heat. You \
learned to hunt firebirds before you could read — not that the clan placed much \
value on reading. Strength was the currency. Loyalty was the law. The elders \
painted your first kill-marks on your shoulders when you were fourteen, and by \
sixteen you had earned your place in the shield circle.

But clans fracture. The drought that killed the highland game sent your people \
scattering across the ridges in search of food, and what had been one clan became \
three bitter fragments. Your chieftain fell in the dispute — a blade in the dark, \
not the warrior's death she deserved. The fragment you belonged to chose exile \
over submission to the rivals who killed her.

You walk the highland road now with your axe across your back and the clan marks \
still bright on your skin. The rage that kept your ancestors alive in the volcanic \
wastes runs in your blood — a fire that answers when you call it. Somewhere beyond \
these ash-stained peaks, there is a purpose worthy of that fire."""

They threw you out at dawn. No trial, no appeal — just the chief's decree and two \
warriors at your back making sure you walked past the boundary stones. Your crime \
was honest: you challenged the chief's son for the right to lead the hunt, and you \
won. Badly. The chief's son kept his life but lost the use of his shield arm, and \
the clan decided that your strength was more dangerous than the beasts outside \
their walls.

The first month alone was the hardest. Not the hunger or the cold — you had trained \
for those. It was the silence. A lifetime of communal fires and shared songs replaced \
by the wind and your own breathing. You learned to talk to yourself just to hear \
a voice, and then you learned to stop needing one.

The Thornwild took you in the way wild places take anyone — indifferently, but \
honestly. You hunt what you need, sleep where you fall, and carry your rage like \
a banked coal in your chest. The briarhaven village on the forest's edge is the \
closest thing you have to a home now. The people there leave food on the boundary \
stone sometimes, and you leave pelts. It is not friendship. It is enough."""

The elders sent you into the deep forest on your sixteenth nameday with a waterskin, \
a knife, and instructions to return only when the spirits had spoken. Three days \
you wandered the Thornwild, eating bark and mushrooms, sleeping in the hollow \
trunks of ancient trees. On the fourth night, the fever came — whether from a bad \
mushroom or genuine spiritual contact, you have never been sure.

The bear came to you in the fever dream. Not a normal bear — something vast and \
old, with eyes like forest fires and a voice that resonated in your bones rather \
than your ears. It pressed its forehead to yours, and you felt something break \
open inside you. A well of fury, deep and hot, connected to something older than \
the forest itself.

You woke with claw marks on your chest that had not been there before. The elders \
examined them, consulted their totems, and declared you totem-touched. The marks \
have never fully healed — they glow faintly when your blood runs hot. You carry \
the bear's gift in your flesh and its fury in your heart, and you have spent \
every day since learning to control both."""

You do not remember the details of the attack. You remember the smell — smoke and \
iron and something worse — and you remember the screaming. Your village on the \
coastal road was small, barely a dozen families, and the raiders came at dawn when \
the fishing boats were out. They burned the thatch roofs first to drive people into \
the open.

What happened next comes to you in fragments. A red haze descending. The weight of \
a woodcutting axe in your hands. The sound it made. When the haze cleared, you were \
standing in the village square surrounded by bodies — some raiders, some not. Your \
arms were slick to the elbows. The surviving villagers looked at you with something \
worse than fear.

You left before they could decide what to do with you. The rage that saved your \
life had also made you a monster in their eyes, and you could not argue. You do \
not remember killing the raiders. You do not remember stopping. That is the part \
that frightens you — not the fury itself, but the gap where your mind should be. \
You have walked the coast road since, looking for someone who can teach you to \
control the thing inside you before it controls you again."""

Above the tree line, where the wind cuts like a blade and the snow never fully \
melts, your people built their homes into the rock itself. The Stoneblood clan \
carved dwellings from the mountainside, heated by volcanic vents that ran beneath \
the obsidian plateau like the veins of a sleeping giant. You grew up scaling cliff \
faces before breakfast and wrestling mountain goats for sport.

The lowlanders never came up. Why would they? The air was thin, the paths were \
treacherous, and the Stonebloods were not known for their hospitality. You had \
everything you needed — meat, warmth, stone, sky, and the deep rumbling of the \
mountain that your grandmother said was the earth breathing.

Then the vents shifted. The warmth that sustained your homes turned to choking \
sulfur, and the mountain that had sheltered you became a deathtrap. The clan \
evacuated down paths they had never intended to use, carrying what they could, \
leaving behind a lifetime of carved stone. You were sent ahead — the youngest, \
the fastest, the angriest — to find a new home in the lowlands. The mountain's \
fury is in your blood, and the lowlands are not ready for what descends."""
