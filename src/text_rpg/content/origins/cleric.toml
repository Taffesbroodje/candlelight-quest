prologue = """
You served the Temple of Light in Thornfield for eleven years. You led morning \
prayers, tended the sick, counseled the grieving, and spoke of divine grace with \
a conviction that filled the stone nave and lifted the hearts of everyone who \
listened. Your faith was a fortress — mortared with scripture, buttressed by \
ritual, unshakeable in the face of doubt. Until the plague came to the outer \
farms, and no amount of prayer stopped the children from dying in their mothers' \
arms.

You prayed harder. You fasted. You knelt on the cold temple floor until your \
knees bled through your robes, begging for intervention, for a sign, for the \
smallest whisper that the suffering served a purpose. The silence that answered \
was not empty — it was vast, a silence with weight and texture, the silence of \
something that could speak and chose not to. That silence broke something in you \
that eleven years of devotion had built.

You still wear the holy symbol. You still feel the divine power move through you \
when you lay hands on the wounded — that, at least, has not abandoned you. But \
the prayers taste different in your mouth now, seasoned with questions that your \
prayer book does not address. The temple elders see the change in you and offer \
platitudes about tests of faith. You nod and smile and say nothing, because the \
truth is worse than doubt: you believe more deeply than ever, and it is the nature \
of what you believe in that has changed."""

summary = "A healer whose divine gifts drew crowds, reverence, and eventually dangerous attention."
prologue = """
The first time you healed someone, you were fourteen. A farmhand had gashed his \
leg on a scythe blade, and the wound was deep enough that the bone showed through. \
You pressed your hands over the torn flesh because you did not know what else to \
do, and the light came — golden, warm, flowing through your fingers like water \
through sand. The wound closed. The farmhand stared. You fainted. When you woke, \
the village was already whispering.

Word spread the way word always does in small communities — fast, distorted, and \
impossible to contain. Within a year, pilgrims were arriving in Thornfield asking \
for the miracle worker. You healed who you could. A child's fever. A merchant's \
shattered wrist. A soldier's infected arrow wound. Each healing left you drained \
and humbled, and each one added another layer to a reputation you had never \
sought. The temple welcomed you, provided training, gave your gift a theological \
framework. But the crowds kept growing, and with them came those who wanted to \
use your gift rather than honor it.

You left Thornfield on a morning when a minor lord's retinue arrived demanding \
that you attend his ailing wife exclusively — at his estate, under his control, \
for an indefinite duration. The temple elders urged you to comply. You packed \
your herbalism kit, tucked your holy symbol beneath your shirt, and slipped out \
through the garden gate before dawn. Your gift belongs to the suffering, not the \
powerful. You will heal on the road, where the need is greatest and the politics \
are simplest."""

summary = "A former cultist who escaped a dark congregation and now seeks redemption through true faith."
prologue = """
They called themselves the Drowned Choir, and for two years you sang with them. \
The recruitment was subtle — a friendly face at a crossroads shrine, an invitation \
to a prayer circle that offered community when you had none, a theology that \
answered the questions the mainstream temples refused to acknowledge. By the time \
you understood what they truly worshipped, you were in too deep to simply walk away. \
The rituals in the Murkfen shrine grew darker by degrees — animal sacrifice, then \
blood oaths, then ceremonies conducted in a language that made your teeth ache \
and your shadow twitch independently of your body.

You broke free on the night of the Submersion, when the Choir's leader demanded \
that the congregation wade into the black water of the fen and breathe it in as \
proof of devotion. Two of your fellow congregants did not surface. You watched \
their candles go out beneath the water, and something inside you — something the \
Choir had not managed to extinguish — screamed loudly enough to drown out the \
chanting. You ran. Through the bog, through the reeds, through mud that sucked \
at your boots like hungry mouths.

The holy symbol you carry now is not the Choir's. You found it in the muck near \
the shrine's outer boundary, half-buried and tarnished — a symbol of a faith \
older and cleaner than the one that had enslaved you. It felt warm in your hand. \
It still does. You do not know if the gods are real, but you know that whatever \
power flows through this symbol pulled you from the dark water, and you owe it a \
debt you intend to repay with every breath you take above the surface."""

summary = "A solemn warden of the dead who speaks the rites that keep the buried at rest."
prologue = """
The living avoid you, and you have made peace with that. For eight years you have \
tended the burial grounds of the Murkfen — the old cemetery on the island where \
the bog's dead are interred according to rites that predate the temple hierarchy \
by centuries. Yours is a solitary vocation. You dig the graves, wash the bodies, \
speak the words that bind the departed to their rest, and ensure that what lies \
beneath the soil stays beneath the soil. In the Sunken Reach, that last duty is \
not ceremonial. The bog remembers its dead, and some of them remember the bog.

You carry a lantern because the mist rolls in without warning, and a shovel because \
the ground here is never fully settled. Your holy symbol hangs from a chain around \
your neck, close enough to grab in the dark, because there have been nights when \
you needed it in a hurry. The locals leave offerings at the cemetery gate — bread, \
coin, wildflowers — but they do not enter, and they do not linger. They are \
grateful for your service in the way people are grateful for chamber pots: \
essential, but not something they wish to discuss at dinner.

Lately, the wards have been straining. You find scratches on the undersides of \
coffin lids that were not there when you sealed them. The candles at the grave \
markers gutter in windless air. Something is stirring in the deeper plots, the \
oldest ones, where the names on the stones have weathered to nothing. You have \
sent word to the temple, but the temple is far away and the dead are patient. \
You tighten your grip on your shovel, adjust your lantern, and walk the rows \
one more time. If the wards fail, you will be the first to know — and the last \
line between the buried and the world above."""

summary = "A devout wanderer who walks the sacred roads seeking divine revelation through hardship."
prologue = """
The pilgrimage began with a vow, spoken at dawn in a temple you will not see again \
until the journey is complete. You swore to walk the old roads — the routes that \
the first priests traveled when the temples were stones in open fields and the gods \
spoke through thunder and birdsong rather than through gilded altars and stained \
glass. Your order calls it the Long Circuit: a path that touches every sacred site \
in the known regions, from the coastal shrines to the highland cairns, from the \
forest groves to the fen chapels. No horse. No carriage. No shortcuts. The road \
is the prayer, and every blister is an offering.

You have walked for months now, sleeping in hedgerows and temple doorways, eating \
what the land provides and what the faithful share. Your boots are held together \
by faith and twine. Your bedroll smells of campfire smoke and pine needles. Your \
holy symbol has been kissed by the lips of a hundred strangers who saw you on the \
road and asked for a blessing. You gave them freely, every one, because a pilgrim \
who hoards grace has misunderstood the point.

The highland road stretches before you, winding through volcanic scree and scrub \
toward the next waypoint on your circuit. The Ashen Highlands are harsh country — \
thin air, sharp stone, and a sky that seems too close. Other pilgrims have warned \
you about the road ahead. Bandits. Rockslides. Creatures that come down from the \
obsidian plateau when the wind shifts. You adjust the bedroll on your shoulders, \
touch the holy symbol at your throat, and keep walking. The road provides. It \
always has."""
