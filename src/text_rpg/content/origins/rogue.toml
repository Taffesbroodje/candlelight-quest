prologue = """
You never learned her real name. She went by the Moth — because she was drawn to \
valuable things and moved without sound. For three years she was your teacher, your \
mentor, and the closest thing to family you had found since the orphanage released \
you at sixteen. She plucked you from a street corner in Saltmere where you were \
picking pockets with more enthusiasm than skill, looked at your hands, and said, \
"Those are good hands. You're wasting them."

The education that followed was rigorous, private, and entirely illegal. Lockpicking \
by candlelight. Rooftop traversal in the rain. The art of reading a room — counting \
exits, identifying the guard rotation, spotting the safe behind the portrait before \
you cross the threshold. She taught you that a true thief never hurries, never \
panics, and never takes more than the job requires. Greed, she said, is the only \
lock that cannot be picked.

One morning you woke to find her gone. No note. No forwarding address. Only the \
crowbar she had carried since before you met, laid across your pillow like a \
graduation gift. The Saltmere underworld whispers theories — she was arrested, she \
retired, she pulled one last legendary job and vanished into the wealth. You do not \
know. You know only that she left you with a set of skills, a code of conduct, and \
an unanswered question: what was she preparing you for? You walk the docks where \
she found you, crowbar in hand, and wait for the answer to find you."""

category = "rogue"
summary = "A spy who served two masters until both discovered the betrayal."
prologue = """
The art of the double agent is not deception — anyone can lie. It is compartmentalization: \
the ability to believe two contradictory truths simultaneously, to serve two masters \
with genuine loyalty while betraying both with clinical precision. You managed it for \
four years, feeding intelligence from the Thornfield guard to an outside interest \
while simultaneously reporting on that interest to the guard's intelligence officer. \
Both sides believed they owned you. Neither suspected they shared you.

The work required a wardrobe of identities. Fine clothes for the officer's briefings. \
Common garb for the dead drops. A disguise kit for the nights when you needed to be \
no one at all. You moved between worlds like water between vessels, adapting your \
accent, your posture, your very mannerisms to match the expectations of whichever \
handler you faced. The pay was extraordinary. The paranoia was worse.

It unraveled, as these things do, through a coincidence too small to have anticipated. \
A guardsman recognized your voice in a tavern where you should not have been. The \
dominoes fell in both directions simultaneously. You had perhaps six hours between \
the first suspicious glance and the warrants being signed. You used them well — \
collecting your emergency funds, donning your most convincing persona, and \
disappearing into the Thornfield Inn under a name that neither master had ever heard. \
The inn is crowded enough to hide in, and the road out of town is close. You sit \
with your back to the wall, watching both doors, and consider your next move with \
the calm of someone who has been planning exits since before they entered the room."""

summary = "A ghost of the city's rooftops and alleyways, unseen and uninvited."
prologue = """
You learned to climb before you learned to read. The rooftops of Saltmere were your \
playground, your highway, and your hiding place — a world above the streets where \
the city watch never looked and the rain pooled in lead gutters that you navigated \
by memory in total darkness. By fifteen you could cross the dockside district from \
the fishmonger's chimney to the harbormaster's roof without touching the ground. \
By eighteen you had mapped every alley, every drainage grate, every shadow deep \
enough to disappear into between one heartbeat and the next.

The skill set found its own market. You never needed to advertise. People who needed \
things observed, things delivered, or things retrieved from difficult places found \
their way to you through whispered referrals. You took no sides, harbored no \
loyalties, and maintained a professional silence that your clients valued more than \
the services themselves. You were not a thief — you were infrastructure, as essential \
and invisible as the sewer system beneath the cobblestones.

But invisibility is not invincibility. A new gang moved into the dockside district \
last season, and their methods are less refined than yours — more violence, less \
finesse, a willingness to burn what they cannot control. They have been absorbing \
or eliminating the independent operators one by one. You are independent. You \
received the invitation to join. You declined. The second message was less polite. \
You have moved to a different safehouse, packed light, and acquired a grappling \
hook for the routes you have not yet memorized. The shadows of Saltmere are \
getting crowded, and you may need to find new ones."""

category = "rogue"
summary = "A dealer in secrets who knows that the right whisper is worth more than a chest of gold."
prologue = """
Gold is crude. Gold can be stolen, counterfeited, or inflated into worthlessness by \
a king with a printing press. Information, on the other hand, only appreciates. You \
understood this principle before you understood arithmetic, and you built your career \
on it. From a quiet corner of the Saltmere Guildhall, you brokered the invisible \
currency that makes the visible economy function — who owes whom, who sleeps with \
whom, which merchant's ships are insured and which are not, which guild master has \
a second family in the highlands.

Your methods are civilized. You do not threaten. You do not steal. You listen, you \
remember, you connect disparate facts into patterns that others cannot see, and you \
sell those patterns to people who find them useful. Your ink and quill have recorded \
more consequential truths than any court scribe's, and your ledger of debts and \
favors is a weapon more potent than any blade in Saltmere.

The problem with trading in secrets is that you inevitably learn one that someone \
will kill to protect. The entry in your ledger is coded, of course — you are not \
a fool — but the interested party knows you have it, and their recent overtures \
have shifted from generous offers to pointed warnings. You have relocated to a \
more defensible position within the guildhall and begun the delicate process of \
establishing insurance: copies of the information placed with trusted associates, \
to be released in the event of your untimely disappearance. It is an old game. \
You have played it before. But the stakes have never been quite this high, and \
you find, to your surprise, that the thrill has not diminished."""

id = "locksmith_turned_crook"
name = "Locksmith Turned Crook"
category = "rogue"
summary = "A master locksmith whose intimate knowledge of security became the perfect tool for circumventing it."
prologue = """
You were the best locksmith in Thornfield, and that is not boasting — it is the \
professional assessment of every merchant, homeowner, and guild officer who hired \
you over seven years of honest trade. Your locks were elegant: pin tumblers machined \
to tolerances that made other smiths squint in disbelief, ward patterns of your own \
design that resisted every picking technique in the standard manuals. You understood \
security the way a poet understands language — not just the rules, but the spaces \
between them, the weaknesses inherent in every mechanism, the fundamental truth that \
every lock is a promise and every promise can be broken.

The turn came gradually. A merchant asked you to open a competitor's strongbox — just \
to check the mechanism, he said, for a patent dispute. The fee was four times your \
weekly earnings. You told yourself it was a one-time exception. It was not. Each job \
was easier than the last, each justification thinner, each payout larger. You opened \
safes, bypassed ward-locks, defeated mechanisms that you yourself had installed. The \
irony was not lost on you. The guilt, such as it was, dissolved in the satisfaction \
of solving each new puzzle.

Then a job went wrong — an alarm you had not anticipated, a guard rotation that did \
not match the schedule you were given. You escaped cleanly, but your face was seen, \
and in a town as small as Thornfield, a face is all it takes. You closed your shop, \
packed your tools, and moved to the market district where reputation is purchased \
rather than earned. Your crowbar feels heavier than your lockpicks, but it opens \
doors just the same. And somewhere in this town, there are locks you have not yet \
met."""
