For years you ran jobs for the Velvet Hand, the guild that controlled every back alley and rooftop between the harbor and the merchant quarter. Burglary, extortion, the occasional smuggling run — you did what needed doing and kept your mouth shut.

Then things went sideways. A job went wrong, or maybe you crossed the wrong people, or maybe you just got tired of looking over your shoulder every time the city watch passed. Either way, you slipped out of Saltmere with what you could carry and a promise to yourself: no more working for someone else's cut.

You stand now on the salt-stained planks of the outer docks, hood pulled low, watching the fishing boats come in. There's opportunity here for someone with your skills — opportunity that doesn't involve a noose."""

Your contacts stretched from Saltmere to ports you'd never name aloud.

The work was good until the harbor master's new lieutenant started taking her job seriously. Three of your crew got pinched. Your boat was impounded. You barely slipped the net yourself, abandoning your cargo in a sea cave and walking away with nothing but the clothes on your back and a pouch of emergency coin.

Now you're back at the docks where it all started, anonymous among the fishermen and longshoremen. You know these waters, these alleys, these people. Rebuilding won't take long — not for someone who knows where the cracks in the system are."""

It ended the way these things always end. The royal navy caught the Maw in shallow waters off the cape. Cannon fire splintered the hull. Vashka went down with the ship — stubborn to the last. You and a handful of survivors made it to shore in a stolen longboat, splitting up before the navy patrols could sweep the beaches.

You dragged yourself into Saltmere three days later, salt-crusted and sunburned, with rope-burned hands and a coil of rigging you couldn't bring yourself to abandon. The sea calls to you still. But for now, dry land will have to do."""

Your last assignment brought you to Thornfield Village, posing as a traveling merchant. The target was simple — observe the comings and goings at the inn, report anything unusual about travelers heading into the Whisperwood. But your handler went silent three weeks ago. No dead drops, no coded messages, nothing. You're operating blind.

You sit in the corner of the Bramble and Boar, nursing an ale and watching the door, as you've done every evening since you arrived. Old habits. The locals think you're just another quiet traveler.

You were the middleman, the essential link between those who stole and those who bought. You appraised, you negotiated, you laundered coin through legitimate transactions. The margins were extraordinary. For years, it worked beautifully — until a particularly distinctive ruby necklace was traced back through your ledgers by a persistent investigator.

You closed up shop overnight, settling debts where you could and burning bridges where you couldn't.

You learned the trails that the rangers don't patrol, the hours when the game wardens change shifts, the art of moving through dense underbrush without snapping a single twig. The forest became your livelihood and your sanctuary. You knew its rhythms better than most druids.

But the rangers have been getting sharper lately, and a trapper you worked with was caught and hanged last month.

You've crawled through collapsed passages, decoded locking mechanisms older than the kingdom, and pried open sarcophagi that hadn't seen light in a thousand years.

Your last con was your best: posing as an emissary of the Temple of Light, collecting tithes from rural villages for a cathedral fund that existed only in your imagination. It worked beautifully for months, until an actual temple envoy arrived in one of the villages you'd already fleeced. The ensuing confusion was dramatic, and your exit was undignified.

You arrived at the Thornfield market with a new name, a new wardrobe, and a confidence born of years spent reading people like open books. This village is small enough to be trusting and large enough to have money. You just need to find the right angle — and the right marks."""

You'd crossed plenty of lines in your life, but watching the Reapers put a torch to a family's home while they begged for mercy was the line you couldn't cross back over. That night, while the others drank and celebrated, you packed what little was yours and vanished into the Thornwild trails.

Grinner doesn't forgive desertion. You know the Reapers' camps, their routes, their signals — which makes you valuable to anyone opposing them, and a target for the gang itself.
