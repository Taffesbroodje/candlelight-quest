prologue = """
The Thornfield Lyceum accepted you on a scholarship — a rare honor for someone \
without family connections or inherited wealth. You arrived with a secondhand \
spellbook and a hunger for knowledge that the academy's dusty professors could \
not satisfy fast enough. The curriculum moved at the pace of the slowest student. \
The theory lectures droned on for hours about principles you had intuited by age \
twelve. You began skipping classes to read ahead, experimenting with cantrips in \
your dormitory, and asking questions that your instructors found uncomfortable.

The breaking point came in your second year, during a transmutation seminar. You \
demonstrated a technique you had developed independently — elegant, efficient, and \
entirely outside the academy's approved methodology. The professor called it \
reckless. The dean called it dangerous. You called it progress. The disciplinary \
hearing lasted twenty minutes. You packed your trunk in ten.

You kept the fragment of your spellbook — the pages covered in your own annotations, \
the margins crammed with original theories that no professor had validated and no \
exam had tested. The Thornfield Inn serves cheap ale and asks no questions, which \
is all you require while you decide what comes next. The academy taught you the \
rules of magic. You intend to discover the exceptions."""

prologue = """
Every library has a restricted section, and you have broken into all of them. The \
pursuit began innocently — a footnote in a history of the Second Age that referenced \
a text no catalogue listed, a spell notation in a language that predated the common \
tongue by millennia. You followed the thread with the patience of a spider and the \
obsession of a moth circling flame. Each forbidden text led to another, each sealed \
archive to a deeper one, until the knowledge you carried in your mind became \
something that made other scholars uncomfortable to stand near.

The masters at your former institution did not expel you. They simply stopped \
inviting you to lectures, stopped responding to your correspondence, stopped \
meeting your eyes in the halls. You were not dangerous — not yet — but you were \
asking questions whose answers had been deliberately buried, and the people who \
buried them had good reasons. You chose not to care about their reasons.

The Sunken Reach called to you through the pages of a journal you found in a dead \
collector's estate — descriptions of a temple complex swallowed by the bog, its \
lower vaults still sealed with wards that predated the current magical tradition. \
You stand at the threshold now, your crystal focus humming against your palm, the \
journal's sketched map committed to memory. Whatever knowledge was locked away \
down here, it was hidden for a reason. You intend to find out if that reason \
still holds."""

prologue = """
Your family has produced a wizard in every generation for as long as the records \
survive — and your family keeps meticulous records. The tower outside Thornfield \
Village, three stories of weathered stone wrapped in climbing ivy and faintly \
glowing ward-lines, has been your home since birth. You learned to read from \
spellbooks, took your first steps on floors inscribed with protective circles, \
and cast your first cantrip before you lost your milk teeth. Magic is not a \
calling for you. It is an inheritance, as natural and inescapable as the color \
of your eyes.

The expectations that accompany such a lineage are considerable. Your grandmother \
was court wizard to a king. Your mother mapped the ley lines of the Verdant Reach \
and published treatises that are still required reading at every academy in the \
realm. Your crystal focus was cut from the same vein of quartz that powered your \
great-grandfather's most famous enchantment. The weight of all this presses down \
on you like a physical thing.

You have talent — everyone agrees on that. What you lack, according to your mother, \
is perspective. "A wizard who has never left the tower," she told you on your \
nameday, "knows only tower magic." She handed you a scroll of pedigree — your \
credentials, your proof of lineage, your ticket to respect among strangers — and \
opened the front door. The village sprawls below, ordinary and mundane, and beyond \
it lies a world that your family has studied from a distance for generations. You \
are the first in a long time to walk into it."""

prologue = """
You do not remember the explosion itself. You remember the preparation — the careful \
arrangement of reagents, the triple-checked circle of containment, the thrill of \
attempting a transmutation that your notes assured you was theoretically sound. You \
remember the hum of gathering energy, the way the air tasted of copper and ozone, \
the moment when the equations in your mind aligned with the forces in the circle \
and everything felt perfect, balanced, inevitable. Then light, and silence, and \
three weeks of darkness.

You woke in the overgrown ruins where they found you — half-buried in rubble that \
had once been a workshop, your crystal focus fused to your palm by heat you do \
not recall feeling. The healers who tended you spoke in careful voices about nerve \
damage and residual thaumic contamination. Your hair grew back in a different color. \
Your dreams are louder now, crowded with formulae that dissolve when you try to \
write them down. Something changed inside you during those three weeks of darkness, \
something the healers cannot name and you cannot undo.

The ruins around you are scorched in patterns that scholars have traveled days to \
study. They call the blast radius "remarkable." They call your survival \
"statistically impossible." You call it Tuesday, because the alternative is to \
scream. Your focus still hums against your scarred palm. The magic still answers \
when you call it. But it answers differently now — rawer, wilder, less interested \
in the careful boundaries you once trusted. You must learn to control what you \
have become, or it will control you."""

prologue = """
Most wizards pursue power. You pursue curiosity. Your specialty — if a word so \
dignified can be applied to your chaotic methodology — is the documentation and \
classification of magical anomalies. Cursed teapots that pour backwards. Mirrors \
that show reflections three seconds delayed. A compass that points toward the \
nearest lie. Your collection, at its peak, filled four rented rooms above a \
chandler's shop in Saltmere and required a rotating schedule of wards to keep \
the more temperamental specimens from interacting.

The academic establishment considers your work frivolous. You consider their work \
boring, which you feel is a more damning criticism. While they debate the finer \
points of evocation theory in their comfortable towers, you crawl through \
marketplaces and estate sales, magnifying glass in hand, searching for the items \
that do not behave as they should. Every oddity tells a story — about the magic \
that created it, the hands that carried it, the world that produced circumstances \
strange enough to bring it into being.

The collection had to be sold when your landlord discovered what was in the rooms. \
The incident with the self-replicating candelabra was, in hindsight, preventable. \
You kept your journal and your magnifying glass — the two tools that matter most — \
and relocated to the market district, where eccentricity is merely a flavor of \
commerce. Your eye for the unusual has not dimmed. If anything, having lost your \
collection has sharpened your hunger to build a new one."""
