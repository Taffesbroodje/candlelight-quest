You grabbed old Harren's shovel from the fence post and charged into the fray, swinging wildly, screaming loud enough to wake the dead. You took a bite on your forearm that still aches in cold weather, but by dawn the wolves were scattered and three lambs were saved. The village celebrated for a week. They carved your name into the milestone at the crossroads.

But the milestone felt more like a gravestone. The village was safe, and suddenly too small. So you packed your things, said your farewells, and walked through the gate at Thornfield Village with the shovel still slung across your back. Somewhere out there, something bigger needs doing."""

The older kids taught you the trade: how to cut a purse without breaking stride, how to vanish into an alley before the mark turned around, how to tell a city guard from a plainclothes watchman by the way they walked.

You were good at it. Better than most. But the older kids grew up into harder people, and the jobs they wanted you to run stopped being about survival and started being about cruelty. A knife in someone's ribs isn't the same as lifting a coin purse. You knew the difference, even if they didn't.

So you slipped away one fog-thick morning, stowed aboard a fishing vessel, and ended up here at the Saltmere docks with nothing but a small knife and the clothes on your back. The air smells like salt and tar and opportunity. You've started over before. You can do it again."""

She gave you a name, a bed, and a purpose: sweep the floors, tend the garden, say your prayers.

You grew up watching other children through the temple windows. They had families, histories, surnames that meant something. You had questions. Who left you here? Why? The lucky coin you were found clutching — was it a gift or an afterthought?

Now you're old enough to seek your own answers. Sister Maren pressed the coin back into your palm the morning you left and said, "The gods put you here for a reason, child. Go find out what it is."

You walked for days. Then weeks. You crossed rivers swollen with spring melt, slept under hedgerows, bartered labor for bread at farmsteads that eyed you with suspicion. Other refugees joined you on the road — hollow-eyed families pushing carts, soldiers with no army left to serve. One by one they peeled away to wherever fate or desperation took them.

You kept walking until the land turned wet and strange, until the trees grew from standing water and the air tasted of peat and rot. A trading post materialized from the mist: Murkfen, they called it. Not much to look at, but the people here don't ask where you came from. That's enough, for now."""

You begrudge the man who profited from it.

Master Torwin was not cruel in the way of villains in stories. He didn't beat you or starve you. He simply treated you as furniture — something to be used, maintained at minimal cost, and replaced when worn out. The other servants learned not to look him in the eye. You never did learn that particular lesson.

This morning he pressed a document into your hands — your writ of release, signed and sealed — and pointed at the door without a word. You walked out into the market square at Thornfield with nothing but the clothes on your back and a belt pouch containing your final wages. The sun felt different on your face. Sharper.

You should have died. The fever took you for nine days, and the healer — herself half-dead — had given up and moved on to patients she thought she could save. But on the tenth morning, you opened your eyes. The spots had faded to silver scars that still mottle your skin. Your body had fought the plague and won, though the victory left its marks: a persistent awareness of mortality, a nose that could smell sickness on the wind, and hands that learned to mix poultices out of pure necessity.

You left the remnants of your village carrying the healer's kit she'd bequeathed you before the end.

So you walked. Through the Ashen Highlands, where the air smelled like sulfur and the ground was warm underfoot. Through refugee camps that were little better than open-air prisons. You learned to sleep with a knife in your hand and to never trust anyone who smiled too easily. The other children formed packs, and the packs had leaders, and the leaders were always the ones willing to do what others wouldn't. You survived by being useful — a lookout, a scout, a shadow that slipped between tents and came back with food.

Now you're old enough that no one calls you a child anymore. The highland road stretches in both directions, and for the first time in your life, the choice of which way to walk is entirely your own."""

You know things: the weight of a weapon, the taste of ale, the constellations overhead. Skills without stories. Knowledge without context. Your hands know how to do things your mind can't explain.

Your pack lies nearby, carefully placed rather than dropped. In one pocket, a folded note in handwriting you don't recognize: "Trust no one. Find the tower. Remember." The ink is fresh. The paper is expensive. Someone wanted you to find this. You pocket the note, stand on unsteady legs, and start walking toward Thornfield Village. Somewhere in this world, your past is waiting.

You've slept under bridges and in haylofts, shared fires with strangers who became friends for a night and were gone by morning. The road is the only constant.

You don't run from anything. You never have. You simply haven't found the place that makes you want to stop. Every village has its charm — the baker who gives away yesterday's bread, the old woman who reads fortunes in tea leaves, the children who chase each other through market stalls. But by the second or third day, the itch returns. The horizon whispers. Your feet answer.

Now, as the sun begins to dip below the treeline, the cobblestone roofs of Thornfield Village rise from the landscape ahead.

He went pale the first time you described them and spent three days locked in the temple archives before emerging with a scroll so old it crumbled at the edges.

"The Luminarch Codex," he whispered, reading aloud in a language you shouldn't have understood but did. It spoke of a child born under a dead star, marked by dreams of silver, who would stand at the threshold between ages. The priest looked at you with an expression that was equal parts awe and pity. "You need to go to Thornfield," he said. "To the temple there. They'll know what to do."

You traveled for days, the holy symbol the priest gave you clutched in your hand like a talisman. Now you stand before the Temple of Light in Thornfield, its white stone gleaming in the afternoon sun. You don't feel chosen. You feel tired and frightened and very, very young.
