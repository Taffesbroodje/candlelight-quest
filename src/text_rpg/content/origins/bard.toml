prologue = """
The road has been your home since you were old enough to carry a lute. Your mother \
was a minstrel before you — one of the traveling kind who moved from inn to inn \
along the coastal road, earning just enough coin to eat and just enough reputation \
to be welcomed back. She taught you three chords before she taught you your letters, \
and by the time you were ten you could hold a taproom's attention through a full \
evening set.

She died in Saltmere during a winter fever, and the innkeeper was kind enough to \
let you stay through the season. When spring came, you picked up her lute and \
walked out the same door she had always walked out of, heading for the next town \
and the next song. You have been walking ever since.

Every inn is a library. Every drunk is a storyteller. You collect tales the way \
merchants collect coin — compulsively, indiscriminately, because you never know \
which story will save your life or open a door. Your fingers know a hundred songs, \
and your tongue knows a hundred more, and the road ahead stretches like an \
unfinished verse waiting for its final rhyme."""

prologue = """
The guildhall in Saltmere employed you for three years as court poet to the Harbor \
Master — a position that sounds grander than it was. Your duties included composing \
flattering verses for trade ceremonies, memorizing the genealogies of visiting \
merchants, and occasionally playing background music at dinners where no one \
listened. The pay was excellent. The creative fulfillment was not.

You had been trained at the College of Eloquence — a real college, with stone walls \
and dusty lecture halls and professors who could parse the metrical structure of \
an ancient epic while simultaneously critiquing your lute technique. They taught \
you that words have power. Literal power. The right phrase, delivered with the \
right intent, can mend a wound or shatter a wall. You believed them. The Harbor \
Master did not.

When your contract expired, you declined renewal. You packed your formal robes, \
your annotated songbooks, and the small crystal focus they had given you at \
graduation, and you walked out through the guildhall's front door for the last \
time. The college taught you that art is magic. The court taught you that magic \
wasted on flattery is no magic at all. Somewhere out there, your words can matter."""

prologue = """
The Thornfield Guard did not advertise for a bard. You simply showed up during a \
skirmish on the farm road — bandits from the Whisperwood, the usual trouble — and \
started singing. Not a battle cry, not a war shout. A song. An old one, the kind \
your grandmother hummed while sharpening kitchen knives. The guards who heard it \
fought harder. The bandits who heard it hesitated. When the dust settled, the \
sergeant asked your name and offered you a meal.

You never officially enlisted. You walked alongside the patrols, singing when \
they marched, singing when they fought, singing when they buried their dead. The \
guards started calling you "Hymn" and treating you like a mascot — until the night \
ambush near the old ruins, when your voice cracked the air like thunder and three \
bandits dropped their weapons and ran. After that, they treated you like a weapon.

But weapons get pointed at things, and the guard captain started pointing you at \
problems you had no business facing. When the orders came to march on the bandit \
camp with you at the front as a "morale officer," you packed your drum and left \
before dawn. Your voice is not a weapon to be aimed. It is a gift to be given \
freely, and you intend to choose your own battles."""

prologue = """
The shrine at Murkfen is older than the swamp. The priests who tend it will tell \
you that the building sank into the bog over centuries, and they are probably right, \
but the archives in its lowest level contain scrolls that predate the written \
history of every kingdom you can name. You were sent there as an apprentice at \
twelve — your parents hoped you would become a priest. Instead, you became a \
reader.

The scrolls spoke of things the modern world has forgotten. Songs that could \
reshape stone. Words that could bind oaths across death itself. The head archivist \
taught you the old languages, the pronunciation marks that transformed mere \
syllables into something that resonated with the fabric of reality. You practiced \
in the flooded lower chambers where no one could hear you, and the first time your \
voice made the water ripple without wind, you knew the scrolls were telling the \
truth.

The archivist released you from your apprenticeship on your twentieth birthday \
with a warning: the old magic is real, but it is not safe. He gave you a copy \
of the foundational canticle and told you to learn restraint before you learned \
power. You are still working on the first part."""

prologue = """
The story about the dragon is not true. Neither is the one about the pirate fleet, \
or the haunted lighthouse, or the time you supposedly seduced a duchess with a \
single ballad. But the stories exist, and they travel faster than you do, and by \
the time you arrive in a new town your reputation has already bought you the best \
seat at the bar and a free meal.

The truth is simpler and, you think, more interesting. You are a very good liar \
who happens to also be a very good musician. You started telling tall tales in the \
Thornfield Inn to impress a barmaid, and the tales took on a life of their own. \
Each retelling added details you never included. Each new town inflated the stakes. \
By the time you reached the coast, you had apparently slain creatures that do not \
exist in species that have not been discovered.

You lean into it. Why not? The world wants heroes, and you are happy to play the \
part while the real heroes do whatever real heroes do. But lately the stories have \
started attracting attention from people who believe them — people who want you \
to do the things they have heard you already did. And there is a small, terrified \
part of you that wonders if maybe you should start living up to your own legend."""
