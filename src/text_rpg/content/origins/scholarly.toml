For years you studied in the great libraries — cross-referencing histories, translating dead languages, cataloging artifacts that most scholars only read about. You earned your place among the learned through relentless inquiry and a memory that borders on the uncanny.

But knowledge has a way of leading you to questions that libraries can't answer. A reference in a crumbling text — a mention of the Whisperwood ruins and a power sealed beneath them — sent you on a journey that no amount of reading could have prepared you for.

You arrived at the temple in Thornfield Village, hoping to access their archives. What you found instead were worried priests, frightened villagers, and a mystery that demands a scholar's mind and a braver heart than you thought you possessed."""

Whether you came to the faith as a child or found it later in life, the routines of devotion shaped you: morning rites, evening vespers, hours of meditation between. You learned the sacred texts until you could recite them from memory, and you tended the sick and weary who came to the temple seeking comfort.

But faith is not a quiet thing. The visions began three months ago — flashes of a ruined place wreathed in pale light, a presence that called without words. Your superiors recognized the signs. "You are being summoned," the high priest said, pressing a holy symbol into your hands. "Go to Thornfield. The temple there will shelter you while you seek understanding."

You stand now in the modest temple of Thornfield Village, your travel-stained robes drawing curious glances from the local clergy. The visions have quieted since your arrival, but the sense of purpose remains — a certainty that your faith has led you here for a reason that transcends prayer."""

The work was tedious to some, but you found satisfaction in precision: each letter formed with care, each margin measured, each page a small monument to order.

It was during the copying of a seized estate's inventory that you found it — a journal hidden between the pages of a mundane ledger, written in a cipher you didn't recognize. You spent weeks decoding it in secret, and what you found was a detailed account of expeditions into ruins that officially don't exist, cataloging discoveries that powerful people wanted buried.

The journal led you to Thornfield Village, where the author had spent their final years. You arrived with your supplies and your questions, posing as a traveling copyist looking for work. The village is small and its records modest, but somewhere in this place are answers to what the journal's author discovered — and why they stopped writing."""

Your work drew attention: some admiring, some suspicious. The alchemists' guild tolerated your experiments as long as they produced sellable potions, but your real research — the theoretical work on elemental binding and material transformation — made them nervous. When an experiment destabilized and took out a wall of the shared laboratory, the guild used it as an excuse to revoke your bench privileges.

You've relocated to the forge district's outer workshops, where the supervision is lighter and the mineral deposits richer. Your supplies are limited but your theories are sound.

You cataloged, preserved, and protected them all. You knew every volume by location, every scroll by condition, every restricted text by the lock that sealed its case. Scholars came to you when they needed something found, because you could locate any work in the collection faster than they could describe it.

It was in the restricted wing that you found the manuscript — water-damaged, partially illegible, but unmistakable in its subject matter. It described a repository of knowledge predating the current kingdom, sealed beneath ruins in a region the text called the "Verdant Reach." The implications were staggering: an entire archive of pre-kingdom scholarship, untouched and unlooted.

You requested a leave of absence, packed your research tools, and traveled to the village nearest the described location. Thornfield is a humble place with no library to speak of, but the ruins in the nearby Whisperwood match the manuscript's descriptions with unsettling precision.

The wandering stars, the comet cycles, the slow precession of constellations that mark the turning of ages. Your charts are meticulous. Your predictions are uncanny. And lately, they've been troubling.

Something is wrong in the sky. A constellation that ancient texts call the Warden has shifted — not in the gradual way of natural precession, but abruptly, as if something knocked it askew. Your calculations suggest the shift corresponds to a location on the surface: a convergence point where celestial and terrestrial forces align. The coordinates point to a region of dense forest and old ruins, far from your mountain observatory.

You descended from the plateau with your charts and your instruments, following the numbers to wherever they lead. The highlands give way to lowlands, and the stars wheel overhead in patterns you've spent a lifetime decoding.

Your knees ache, your back protests, and your hands are calloused from the shovel, but there is no finer feeling than being the first person in a thousand years to touch something made by hands long turned to dust.

The Sunken Reach has haunted academic circles for decades. A pre-kingdom civilization — sophisticated, literate, and utterly vanished — left structures here that the bog has been slowly swallowing for centuries. Previous expeditions mapped the upper chambers but never breached the lower levels, driven back by flooding, structural collapse, and what one journal politely described as "atmospheric disturbances."

You've secured modest funding and traveled to the sunken temple site with your tools, your journal, and a determination that borders on obsession. The locals think the ruins are cursed. You think they're the most important archaeological find in a generation. You intend to prove it."""

The Thornwild drew you like a moth to flame. It's one of the last great wild places — an ancient forest ecosystem where the boundary between the natural and the supernatural is paper-thin. Fey crossings, awakened beasts, plant species found nowhere else in the known world. Your herbalism kit has never been so full, and your journal has never filled so quickly.

You've made camp near the Briarhaven grove, where the druids tolerate your presence as long as you respect the forest's rules.

Your maps are prized for their accuracy — every contour line measured, every landmark verified, every distance paced out on foot.

But it's the blank spaces that call to you. The guild's master map has regions marked only with old notations: "unexplored," "disputed," "here be dangers." The Verdant Reach is one such region — partially mapped along its trade roads but largely uncharted beyond the village boundaries. The Whisperwood, in particular, is a cartographic void. No reliable map of its interior exists.

You arrived in Thornfield with your tools and a commission from the guild to produce a definitive survey of the region.

What is the nature of divine power, and how does it differ from arcane magic? Are the gods truly immortal, or are they simply beings of such vast power that mortal lifespans cannot witness their decline? These questions earned you respect in academic circles and suspicion in religious ones.

Your research led you to the Murkfen shrine — an ancient holy site predating the organized temples, where pilgrims once came to commune with a divine presence that no modern theology can identify. The shrine's inscriptions have resisted translation for centuries, but your comparative analysis of pre-kingdom religious texts suggests a connection to a forgotten deity — one whose worship was deliberately erased from the historical record.

The shrine sits half-submerged in the Sunken Reach, tended by a single elderly keeper who speaks little but watches everything. You've set up your study in the dry upper chambers, surrounded by inscriptions that may hold the key to understanding something the established churches would prefer to remain forgotten.

A pattern in your research brought you to Thornfield. You'd been studying the pre-kingdom civilizations — the ones that built the ruins scattered across the Verdant Reach before vanishing so completely that even their name is lost. The standard histories say they simply declined and were absorbed by successor cultures. But the archaeological record tells a different story: a sudden end, a catastrophic collapse, and evidence of something that the contemporary accounts describe only as "the Unmaking."

You've come to Thornfield to access local records and interview villagers whose families have lived in the shadow of these ruins for generations.
