prologue = """
The ceremony was simple. You knelt in the Thornfield Temple before the altar of \
light, placed your sword across the stone, and spoke the words that would define \
the rest of your life. The oath was ancient — older than the temple, older than the \
village — and the weight of it settled on your shoulders like armor you could never \
remove. You swore to protect the innocent, to show mercy to the penitent, and to \
stand between darkness and those who cannot stand for themselves.

The priest who administered the oath was old and tired and honest enough to warn \
you: the world does not reward righteousness. It punishes it. The oath will demand \
things of you that no sane person would choose, and it will provide no comfort \
when the cost grows heavy. But the divine power that flows through sworn paladins \
is real, and it does not come from the temple or the altar or the words. It comes \
from meaning them.

You felt the power for the first time when you stood — a warmth in your chest that \
had nothing to do with the candles, a certainty in your bones that had nothing to \
do with courage. The oath is your compass now. Everything else — comfort, safety, \
approval — is secondary."""

prologue = """
The order expelled you. Not for cowardice, not for incompetence — for mercy. The \
prisoner you released was a child, barely thirteen, caught stealing bread from the \
temple stores. The order's law was clear: theft from sacred ground is punishable by \
the removal of the offending hand. You looked at the child's thin wrists and the \
bread crumbs on their lips, and you cut the ropes instead.

The commander called it insubordination. The council called it a violation of \
sacred trust. You called it the only decision you could live with, and you told \
them so. They stripped your insignia, confiscated your armor, and walked you to the \
gate in your underclothes. The child was long gone. You hope they ate well.

The divine power has not left you. This is the part that confuses the theologians — \
you broke your oath to the order, but the oath to something deeper held. The light \
still answers when you call it, the healing still flows through your hands, and the \
certainty in your chest burns as bright as ever. Perhaps the oath was never to the \
order at all. Perhaps it was to something that values mercy more than law."""

prologue = """
The vision came without warning. You were sleeping in your modest room above the \
Cinderhold forge where you worked as a smith's apprentice, and between one breath \
and the next, the ceiling dissolved into blinding light. A voice that was not a \
voice — more like the sound of a cathedral bell filtered through sunlight — told \
you three things. First, that the world was in danger. Second, that you had been \
chosen. Third, that the power to act was already inside you.

When you woke, your hands were glowing. The apprentice in the next bed screamed. \
The smith fired you before breakfast. But when you touched the burn on a stable \
boy's arm and it healed without a scar, the smith's expression changed from anger \
to something much more complicated.

You do not know which god chose you. The voice did not identify itself, and the \
temple scholars you consulted could not agree. What you know is that the power is \
real, the calling is real, and the danger — whatever it is — is real. You walk the \
highland road with divine light in your hands and a message you do not fully \
understand, hoping to find someone who can help you interpret it."""

summary = "A self-appointed protector of the powerless who draws strength from defending others."
prologue = """
You never planned to be a hero. You were a farm hand on the outskirts of the \
Verdant Reach, strong but unremarkable, content with the rhythm of planting and \
harvest and the simple satisfaction of honest work. The bandits changed that. They \
came in autumn, after the harvest, when the granaries were full and the farmers' \
pockets were not. They took what they wanted and hurt anyone who objected.

You objected. Not with words — with a shovel, and then with a fence post, and \
then with your bare hands when both of those broke. You stood in the doorway of \
the widow Maera's farmhouse and refused to move, and something happened that \
neither you nor the bandits expected. A light gathered around your fists, a \
warmth that had nothing to do with exertion, and the bandit leader stumbled \
backward as if you had struck him with a mace instead of a fist.

The bandits ran. The widow blessed you. The village priest examined your hands \
and said a word you had only heard in sermons: paladin. Not by training, not by \
ordination, but by the sheer force of your refusal to let harm reach those who \
cannot prevent it. The power comes from the conviction, and the conviction comes \
from a simple truth you have never been able to ignore: someone has to stand up."""

prologue = """
The crusade lasted four years. Four years of marching, fighting, praying, and \
burying the dead in foreign soil. You joined at eighteen, full of conviction and \
the certainty that divine purpose guided your blade. The enemy was monstrous — \
undead legions raised by a necromancer in the far north — and the cause was just. \
Of that, you have never doubted.

What you doubt is the cost. The villages burned to deny the enemy shelter. The \
prisoners executed because the army could not spare guards to watch them. The \
chaplains who blessed each atrocity with the same serene smile they used for \
morning prayers. You followed orders. You fought with distinction. You earned \
commendations that you keep folded in your pack but have never displayed.

The crusade ended when the necromancer fell, and the army dissolved, and the \
soldiers went home to families who could not understand what they had become. You \
did not go home. Home is a place for people who sleep without screaming. Instead, \
you walk the roads with your sword and your uncertainty, helping where you can, \
and hoping that enough small good deeds can balance the ledger against the large \
ones you can never undo."""
