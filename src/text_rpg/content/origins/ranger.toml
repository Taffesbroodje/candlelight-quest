The cartographer's guild in Saltmere pays well for accurate maps of places no one \
has mapped before. You have been collecting that pay for six years, walking into \
territory that the guild marks with the polite notation "unexplored" and that the \
locals mark with the more honest notation "here be death." You have mapped three \
new river systems, two mountain passes, and a network of caves that the Sunken \
Reach traders now use to bypass the winter floods.

Your tools are simple: a compass, a measuring rope, a stack of parchment treated \
to resist water, and the bow you carry for the things that object to being mapped. \
You have learned that the wilderness is not hostile — it is indifferent, which is \
worse. A hostile enemy can be fought. An indifferent landscape will kill you through \
carelessness and bad luck, and the only defense is attention.

The guild's latest commission is their most ambitious: a full survey of the \
Thornwild interior, where the trees grow so thick that the canopy blocks the sun \
and the trails change with the seasons. No one has successfully mapped it. Three \
previous surveyors went in. Two came back. The third became a cautionary tale that \
the guild tells new recruits. You are not a cautionary tale. You are very, very \
careful, and you intend to prove it."""

The stories say you were raised by wolves. The truth is both more mundane and more \
remarkable. You wandered into the Thornwild at age four — no one knows how or why, \
and you have no memory of a life before the forest. What you remember is the den. \
A family of wolves accepted you the way they would accept a particularly useless \
pup: with tolerance, occasional discipline, and a pragmatic recognition that you \
were simply there.

You learned to walk silently because the wolves expected it. You learned to read \
the wind because the wolves depended on it. You learned to fight because the \
forest demanded it. By the time the rangers found you at age twelve, you could \
not speak but you could track a deer across bare rock and communicate with animals \
through body language more eloquently than most people communicate with words.

The rangers taught you language. You taught them how the forest actually works. It \
was a fair trade. You live at the lodge now, nominally civilized, but you still \
sleep better outside than in, and you still trust the judgment of animals more \
than the judgment of people. The forest is not where you were lost. It is where \
you were found."""

prologue = """
The border between the Verdant Reach and the Whisperwood is not marked on any map, \
but everyone who lives near it knows exactly where it falls. On one side, farms \
and fences and the comfortable sounds of human habitation. On the other, ancient \
trees and the uncomfortable certainty that something is watching. You have patrolled \
that border for eight years, ensuring that the things in the forest stay in the \
forest and the people on the farms stay on the farms.

The work is lonely. You walk a circuit of twenty miles, checking snare lines, \
reading animal signs, and occasionally discouraging something with teeth and claws \
from venturing too close to the livestock. The farmers wave when they see you. The \
children bring you apples. The mayor sends a stipend that barely covers arrows. It \
is thankless work, and it matters more than any work you have ever done.

The Whisperwood has been restless lately. The usual predators have retreated deeper, \
and something new is moving in the canopy — something large enough to shake \
branches but quiet enough to avoid your traps. You have reported this to the \
militia. They smiled and nodded. The border warden sees what no one else will \
look at, and warns of what no one else will believe."""

prologue = """
The guild calls you a "recovery specialist." The courts call you a bounty hunter. \
The people you bring back call you worse things. You prefer "tracker," because \
tracking is the part you are good at. The apprehension is just the final step in \
a process that began with a footprint, a broken twig, or the direction a horse \
was facing when it was last watered.

You learned the trade from your father, who learned it from his mother, who \
allegedly learned it from an elf — though you suspect that last part was \
embellishment. The skills are real regardless: how to read a trail days old, how \
to predict where a fugitive will rest based on the terrain, how to close distance \
without being detected. Your father always said that the best capture is the one \
where the target does not know you are there until they feel the rope.

The Iron Coast courts keep you busy. Smugglers, deserters, debtors who flee their \
obligations — the sea breeds a particular kind of criminal who thinks that boarding \
a ship is the same as disappearing. It is not. Ships dock. Sailors talk. And you \
are very, very patient."""

The Sunken Reach is the least-documented region in the known world. The swamp \
resists documentation — trails change with the water level, landmarks sink or \
emerge with the seasons, and the creatures that live there rearrange the landscape \
simply by existing. You have spent four years attempting the impossible: a \
comprehensive survey of the bog system, its waterways, its flora, and its fauna.

Your journals fill three waterproof cases. You have cataloged forty-seven species \
of aquatic plant, nineteen previously unknown insects, and a fish that glows blue \
during mating season. Your maps are works of art — precise, color-coded, annotated \
with seasonal variation notes that would make the cartographer's guild weep with \
professional envy.

The trading post at Murkfen has been your base of operations. The locals think you \
are eccentric but harmless, and they appreciate the practical benefits of your \
maps — knowing which trails flood in spring has saved more than one merchant from \
drowning. But the deep interior remains unmapped. The locals refuse to guide you \
there, citing reasons that range from "cursed" to "something big lives in the \
temple." You intend to find out what, document it thoroughly, and add it to the \
appendix."""
