prologue = """
You remember the roar of the crowd the way other people remember their first kiss — \
total, overwhelming, a sound that filled your chest and lifted you off the ground. \
The tournament circuits of the Iron Coast were your stage for three seasons running. \
You fought with longsword, mace, and bare fists across the salt-stained arenas of \
Saltmere, collecting medals and broken bones in roughly equal measure. The crowds \
chanted your name. The bookmakers cursed it.

But tournaments are spectacle, not war, and you always knew the difference. The \
padded tips and blunted edges kept the kills theoretical. When a real blade found \
your shoulder in the semifinal at Storm Point — an opponent who forgot the rules, \
or never cared — the crowd gasped, and you saw their faces change. They wanted \
blood, but only in the abstract. The wound healed. Your appetite for performing \
did not.

You pawned your last trophy for road supplies and walked away from the arena \
district on a market morning, the medal around your neck catching the light one \
final time. The skills that made you a champion are real. The adoration was not. \
Somewhere beyond the cheering stands, there are fights that matter — and you intend \
to find them."""

prologue = """
You stood between your charge and the world for the better part of a decade. \
Every doorway you entered, you entered first. Every room you left, you left last. \
Your eyes never rested — scanning rooftops, counting exits, reading the hands of \
strangers for the telltale drift toward a concealed weapon. You were not a servant. \
You were a shield made of flesh and reflex, and for years, no harm passed through \
you.

Then came the night at the river crossing. You had warned your lord about the \
route, about the broken lanterns on the bridge, about the way the local patrols \
had thinned. He waved you off. He always waved you off. The ambush came from \
both banks — crossbow bolts and rushing shadows. You cut down three of them before \
the fourth put a quarrel through your thigh. When you dragged yourself to where \
your lord had fallen, he was already gone.

They did not execute you. That would have been kinder. Instead, they stripped your \
insignia, published your failure in the court record, and turned you out through \
the servants' gate. You carry the insignia still — you took it from the refuse pile \
where they threw it. The wound in your leg healed into a limp you barely notice. \
The wound in your pride has not healed at all. You sit in the Thornfield Inn, \
nursing an ale and your shame, waiting for the chance to prove that one failure \
does not define a life."""

prologue = """
The academy at Cinderhold was not a school in any comfortable sense of the word. \
There were no dormitories, no feast halls, no holidays. There was the training \
yard — a rectangle of packed volcanic ash surrounded by stone walls scarred with \
a century of blade marks — and there was Master Voren. She taught you to hold a \
sword before she taught you to read, and she considered both skills equally vital. \
You drilled forms at dawn, studied the treatises of legendary duelists by \
candlelight, and spent your afternoons sparring until your arms felt like lead \
and your mind felt like glass — clear, sharp, empty of everything except the next \
strike.

Voren accepted no payment. Her price was obedience and, eventually, excellence. \
You gave her both, year after year, until the morning she met you at the gate \
with your pack already assembled and a look on her weathered face that you had \
never seen before. Pride, perhaps. Or something close to it.

"The yard teaches you to fight," she said. "The world teaches you why." She pressed \
a sealed letter into your hand — your certification, your letter of passage, your \
final exam. The instructions were simple: go, test your training against what is \
real, and return only when you have something to teach her. You bowed, shouldered \
your pack, and walked through the highland gate without looking back."""

prologue = """
The highland pass was supposed to hold. Forty soldiers against a raiding party \
twice their number — bad odds, but the terrain favored defense, and your captain \
was the best tactician you had ever served under. She positioned the shield wall \
at the narrowest point, archers on the ridgeline, reserves behind the second \
barricade. It should have worked. It would have worked, if the enemy had come \
from only one direction.

They flanked through a goat trail that the scouts had dismissed as impassable. \
The archers fell first. Then the reserves. Then the shield wall buckled inward \
like a crushed ribcage, and what had been a disciplined defense became a slaughter. \
You fought with your back to a boulder, your shield arm numb, your blade chipped \
to a ragged edge. When the enemy finally withdrew at dusk — not defeated, merely \
satisfied — you were the only one still standing. The silence that followed was \
worse than the screaming.

You buried who you could. You took the captain's insignia from her body because \
someone should carry it, and you could not bear to leave it in the dirt. The \
highland road stretches before you now, empty and windswept, and every step takes \
you further from the pass and closer to something you have not yet named. It is \
not revenge. It is not grief. It is the quiet, immovable certainty that you \
survived for a reason, and you owe it to the dead to find out what it is."""

prologue = """
The farmlands outside Thornfield do not have city walls or standing garrisons. \
They have you — or they had you, until recently. For six years you walked the \
farm roads with a set of manacles on your belt and a reputation that preceded you \
by a quarter mile. Cattle thieves, squatters, drunken brawlers, poachers crossing \
from the Whisperwood — you dealt with them all. Not always gently. Gentleness, \
you learned early, is a luxury that frontier law cannot afford.

The farmers respected you. The troublemakers feared you. The magistrate in \
Thornfield tolerated you, mostly because you kept the problems far enough from \
his door that he could pretend they did not exist. You collected no salary, only \
a share of recovered goods and the grudging hospitality of the homesteads you \
protected. It was enough. You slept soundly, knowing the roads were safer for \
your presence.

Then the magistrate changed, and the new one brought his own enforcers — younger, \
cheaper, and willing to look the other way when his friends bent the rules you \
had spent years enforcing. Your services were no longer required. The dismissal \
was polite. The message was clear. You walk the farm road still, but now as a \
traveler rather than its guardian. The manacles at your belt feel heavier than \
they used to. The road feels less like yours. But the instinct to protect — the \
reflex that makes you scan the tree line and listen for hoofbeats — that has not \
faded, and you doubt it ever will."""
