Your sister was dying. The fever that swept through the Verdant Reach spared most \
but destroyed the weakest, and your sister — gentle, bookish, and constitutionally \
fragile — was among them. The temple healers exhausted their magic. The herbalists \
shook their heads. On the third night, when her breathing became a rasp and her \
skin turned the color of old parchment, you walked into the Whisperwood and \
screamed into the darkness. You did not care what answered, as long as something \
did.

Something answered. A voice like smoke and honey, coming from everywhere and \
nowhere, offering exactly what you needed. Your sister would live. In exchange, \
you would serve. Not immediately, not constantly, but when called upon, you would \
act as the entity's agent in the material world. The terms were maddeningly vague. \
You agreed without hesitation.

Your sister recovered overnight. The fever broke like a snapped twig, and by \
morning she was sitting up and asking for soup. The entity has been quiet since — \
no commands, no contact, just the occasional sensation of being watched and the \
arcane power that flows through your veins like borrowed lightning. You know the \
bill is coming. You also know that you would make the same choice again without \
a moment's pause."""

prologue = """
The wizards would not teach you. Three applications to the arcane academy, three \
rejections, each more politely dismissive than the last. Insufficient aptitude, \
they said. Insufficient discipline. Insufficient whatever quality they had decided \
you lacked. The truth, which you eventually forced from a sympathetic professor \
over drinks, was simpler: you had too much raw talent and not enough patience to \
channel it safely. They were afraid of what you might become.

So you became exactly what they feared. The texts in the restricted section of the \
Saltmere guildhall described rituals for contacting extraplanar entities — beings \
of immense power who would share their knowledge in exchange for service. The \
warnings were explicit. The consequences were detailed. You read every word and \
performed the ritual anyway, because power that comes with conditions is still \
power, and power without conditions does not exist.

The entity that answered was not what you expected. It was older, vaster, and more \
patient than any demon the texts described. It offered knowledge freely and asked \
only that you use it — that you push the boundaries of what mortal magic can \
achieve, and report what you discover. A patron that wants you to learn. It sounds \
too good to be true, and you are wise enough to know that it probably is."""

prologue = """
You were reading a book. That is the absurd, infuriating truth — you were reading \
a book in the Murkfen shrine's archive, practicing your pronunciation of an \
ancient text for a translation exercise, and you accidentally spoke the words of \
a binding ritual that had been transcribed alongside a religious hymn by a scribe \
who clearly did not understand what they were copying.

The shrine's basement flooded with green light. The pages of the book turned to \
ash in your hands. And a voice — cultured, amused, and profoundly inhuman — said: \
"Finally. That took four hundred years. I was beginning to think the language had \
died." The entity did not ask permission. It did not offer terms. It simply \
declared that since you had completed the ritual, the pact was sealed, and you \
should expect certain changes.

The changes arrived over the following week. Visions of distant planes during \
sleep. The ability to see in darkness. An instinctive knowledge of spells you had \
never studied. And, most unsettlingly, a new voice in the back of your mind — not \
controlling, not commanding, just present. Watching. Occasionally commenting. \
You did not choose this power. You were not brave or foolish enough to seek it. \
You pronounced a word correctly, and the universe decided that was sufficient."""

The entity contacted you, not the other way around. You were a debt collector \
for the merchant guild in Saltmere — the mundane kind, who knocks on doors and \
delivers stern letters and occasionally persuades reluctant debtors through the \
force of personality rather than the threat of violence. You were good at it. \
Excellent, actually. Your record of collections was the highest in the guild, \
achieved through a combination of charm, persistence, and an almost supernatural \
ability to find people who did not want to be found.

The entity noticed. It appeared in your dreams first — a silhouette of smoke and \
flame, offering an upgrade. Your talent for tracking debts could be applied to \
a different kind of obligation: broken pacts, unfulfilled promises, bargains \
sealed in the old ways that stretched back centuries. The material world was full \
of outstanding debts, and the entity needed an agent with feet on the ground.

The power came with the agreement. You can feel the debts now — they register as \
a faint pull, like a compass needle, pointing toward promises that remain \
unfulfilled. The entity does not care about gold or goods. It cares about \
balance. Every broken promise is a crack in the fabric of the world, and you \
have been deputized to seal them. The pay is supernatural power. The work is \
dangerous. The retirement plan is unclear."""

The sunken temple in the Reach was supposed to be empty. The archaeological team \
that hired you as a guide said it had been abandoned for centuries — just old stone \
and stagnant water and the occasional bat. They were wrong about the empty part. \
Something was waiting in the lowest chamber, behind a door that should not have \
opened but did when you touched it.

The entity was dying. Not a demon, not a devil — something else entirely, from a \
plane the scholars do not have a name for. It was vast and luminous and fading, \
and it spoke directly into your mind with a desperation that bypassed language \
entirely. It needed a host. A vessel. A place to shelter while it recovered \
enough strength to survive on its own. In exchange, it would share its power.

You said yes because it was dying, and because something about its desperation \
felt genuine, and because you have always had a weakness for things that need \
help. The merger was instantaneous and overwhelming — knowledge flooding in like \
water through a broken dam, arcane power burning along your nerve endings, and a \
presence settling into the back of your mind like a guest who intends to stay \
awhile. You are no longer alone in your own head. You are not sure you mind."""
