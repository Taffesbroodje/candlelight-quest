The temple at Thornfield took you in on a rainy night when you were small enough \
to fit in a bread basket — which is, according to the abbot, exactly how you \
arrived. A basket, a blanket, and a note that said only "please." The monks raised \
you alongside their prayers and their training forms, and by the time you were old \
enough to wonder where you came from, you had already become too much a part of \
the temple to leave.

Brother Cael taught you the open-hand forms. Sister Maren taught you meditation. \
The abbot taught you that the body is a temple of its own — that every joint and \
muscle is a prayer waiting to be spoken, and that the discipline to control your \
own flesh is the first step toward controlling the world around you.

You are not a monk by vow. You are a monk by upbringing, which is both more and \
less than a vow. The temple asks nothing of you except that you live honestly and \
return when you can. The abbot pressed a few coins into your hand at the gate and \
told you that the world outside the walls would teach you things the temple could \
not. You are not sure you believe him, but you trust him enough to try."""

prologue = """
You own nothing. This is not poverty — it is a choice, the most deliberate choice \
you have ever made. Three years ago you were a merchant's clerk in Saltmere, \
counting coins and inventorying cargo and slowly drowning in the accumulated weight \
of things. The breaking point was trivial: a shipping manifest that listed four \
hundred crates of silk, and the sudden, crystalline realization that not one of \
those crates would make a single person genuinely happy.

You walked out of the counting house, gave your coat to the first beggar you saw, \
and kept walking. For three years you have owned only what you wear and what you \
carry, and you have discovered that the body, unburdened by possessions, becomes \
something extraordinary. Your feet have hardened to leather. Your reflexes have \
sharpened beyond anything training could achieve. When you stopped reaching for \
things, your hands became tools of remarkable precision.

The road teaches a different discipline than any monastery. Every meal is earned. \
Every shelter is temporary. Every person you meet is a lesson in impermanence. You \
are lighter now than you have ever been — lighter in body, in mind, in spirit — \
and the road keeps unrolling ahead of you like a meditation mat without end."""

The fighting pits of Saltmere have rules. Not many, but enough: no weapons, no \
magic, no killing. Everything else is permitted. You entered on a dare from a \
dockworker who thought your slight frame was funny, and you left with a broken \
nose, two cracked ribs, and the tournament purse. The dockworker was not laughing \
when you dropped the pit champion in three moves that nobody in the audience had \
ever seen.

You trained yourself. No monastery, no master, no ancient tradition — just years \
of watching, imitating, and refining. You studied the way cats land on their feet \
and applied it to falling. You watched the way water flows around obstacles and \
applied it to blocking. The fighting pit regulars called your style "the weird \
one," which you took as a compliment.

Three tournament wins made you a local celebrity. Four made you a target. The \
fifth was cancelled after someone tried to poison your water between rounds. You \
took the hint and left Saltmere with your winnings and your reputation, looking \
for a place where your skills could be used for something more meaningful than \
entertainment and gambling odds."""

prologue = """
The island in the Sunken Reach is too small to have a name and too remote to have \
visitors. You built your shelter from driftwood and reeds, grew vegetables in the \
silty soil, and spent five years doing nothing but breathing, thinking, and \
perfecting the forms your body could achieve when the mind was perfectly still.

The stillness was the goal. Not the absence of thought — the fullness of it. A \
mind so complete that every sensation was noticed and released without grasping. \
In the third year, you caught a fly in midair without deciding to catch it. In the \
fourth year, you dodged a falling branch before you heard it crack. In the fifth \
year, you sat so still that a family of herons built a nest on your shoulders \
during a week-long meditation.

The world intruded, as it does. A wounded trader washed up on your island, \
babbling about bandits and corruption and a darkness spreading through the lowlands. \
You healed him, fed him, and sent him away. Then you sat with the knowledge he had \
brought and understood, with perfect clarity, that peace maintained through \
isolation is not peace at all. It is avoidance. True peace must be carried into \
the places where it is needed most."""

prologue = """
The backstreets of Thornfield are not the worst in the world, but they taught you \
everything you needed to know about hitting and being hit. You ran with a gang of \
pickpockets and enforcers from the age of twelve, collecting debts with your fists \
and your reputation. By sixteen you were the best bare-knuckle fighter in the lower \
quarter, which meant you were also the most feared and the most alone.

The change came after you nearly killed a man over a gambling debt. He was older, \
slower, and owed less than the cost of the meal you ate afterward. You stood over \
his bleeding body in an alley and felt something you had not felt in years: shame. \
Not for the violence — violence was a tool, no different from a hammer. But for \
the purposelessness of it. You were strong, fast, and skilled, and you were using \
those gifts to break old men in alleys.

The temple took you in. Not as a convert — you have no faith to speak of — but as \
a student. The monks there taught you that the same hands that break can also heal, \
and that the discipline of controlled violence is a thousand times more powerful \
than the chaos you had mastered. You train now with purpose. The streets made you \
dangerous. The temple is making you something better."""
