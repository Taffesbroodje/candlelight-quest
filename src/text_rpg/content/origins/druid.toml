The Circle of the Thornwild does not accept applicants. They find you, or they \
do not, and the finding happens in ways that cannot be faked. For you, it was \
the night you walked into the forest to die. You had lost everything — home, \
family, purpose — and the ancient trees seemed as good a place as any to let \
the world have the last word.

The forest had other plans. The trees guided your feet along paths that should \
not have existed, past groves that glowed with phosphorescent moss and streams \
that whispered in a language older than words. You walked for three days without \
hunger or thirst, and on the fourth morning you found the circle — twelve druids \
seated around a fire that burned without fuel, waiting for you as though you had \
been expected.

They taught you the old tongue. They taught you to feel the pulse of the earth \
through your bare feet and to hear the intentions of the wind. After a year of \
training, the elder pressed a focus into your hands and told you that your \
initiation required one thing: to walk back into the world you had tried to \
leave, and to protect it. The circle's magic is strongest when its members are \
scattered like seeds."""

summary = "A druid who understands that destruction and renewal are the same flame."
prologue = """
The Ashen Highlands teach a lesson that gentler lands forget: fire is not the \
enemy of life. It is the prerequisite. The volcanic soil that feeds the highland \
meadows exists because of eruptions that leveled forests centuries ago. The seeds \
that sprout after a wildfire grow stronger than anything that came before. You \
learned this from the highland druids who tend the burn lines — carefully setting \
controlled fires to renew the land before wildfire can consume it unchecked.

Your mentor was a half-blind woman named Ashara who could read the health of a \
forest the way a physician reads a pulse. She taught you to ignite and to quench, \
to judge which trees must burn so that others may live, and to stand in the heart \
of controlled fire without flinching. The flames do not harm those who serve them \
honestly.

When the sulfur springs shifted and poisoned the eastern meadows, Ashara sent you \
west to study the corruption and find its source. She suspected something \
unnatural — not volcanic activity, but deliberate corruption. You carry her \
knowledge of fire and renewal in your hands, and her suspicion of unnatural \
destruction in your mind."""

prologue = """
The Sunken Reach is not beautiful. The water is dark, the air is thick, and the \
things that live beneath the surface do not appreciate visitors. But beauty was \
never the point. The swamp is the oldest living thing you have ever met — a vast, \
interconnected organism of water, mud, and decay that processes death into life \
with a patience that makes mountains seem hasty.

Your grandmother taught you to listen to it. She was the swamp oracle before you, \
and her grandmother before her, stretching back in an unbroken line to a time \
when the Sunken Reach covered half the continent. The oracle sits at the trading \
post and reads the water — the color of the algae, the movement of the fish, the \
direction of the current — and tells the traders what the swamp wants them to know.

The swamp told you to leave. Not in words — in the way the water flowed, in the \
pattern of the lily pads, in the behavior of the herons that watch the shallows. \
Something is coming. Something that will need you to be elsewhere when it arrives. \
You trust the swamp. You have never known it to be wrong."""

prologue = """
The grove at the heart of the Thornwild has no name that human tongues can \
pronounce. The trees there are older than the forest itself — survivors from a \
time when the entire continent was woodland, before the axes came and the cities \
rose. You were chosen as guardian at birth, marked by the elder tree's pollen \
that drifted through your mother's window on the night you were born.

For twenty years you tended the grove. You knew every root, every branch, every \
creature that nested in the canopy. The grove spoke to you through the rustle of \
leaves and the creak of ancient wood, and you answered by pulling invasive weeds, \
redirecting streams, and gently persuading predators to hunt elsewhere.

Then the blight came. Not from within — the grove's own defenses would have \
handled that. From somewhere beyond the forest's edge, a corruption crept along \
underground waterways, turning roots black and leaves to ash. The elder tree \
told you, in its slow arboreal way, that the source was beyond the grove's \
borders. Beyond yours, too. But someone must go, and the grove cannot walk."""

The lighthouse at Storm Point has not needed a keeper in decades. The storms that \
batter the Iron Coast are managed — not controlled, never controlled, but guided — \
by the storm callers who live in the keeper's quarters. Your master was one of \
three, an ancient woman with hair like white lightning who could feel a pressure \
change three days before the wind arrived.

She taught you that weather is alive. Not sentient, not willful, but alive in \
the way that fire is alive — it feeds, it grows, it destroys, and it renews. \
A storm caller does not command the weather. They negotiate. They suggest. They \
offer the path of least resistance and hope the storm takes it.

Your apprenticeship ended the night a hurricane ignored your master's guidance \
and drove straight for the fishing fleet. She walked into the storm to redirect \
it personally, and when morning came, the fleet was safe and your master was gone. \
The lighthouse stands empty now. The other storm callers dispersed to other coasts. \
You carry your master's teachings and her final lesson: the storm always wins \
eventually. The trick is choosing which battles to fight."""
