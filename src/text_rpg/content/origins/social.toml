You were raised behind stone walls draped in silk, where every meal was a negotiation \
and every smile concealed a blade. The manor overlooking Thornfield Village was your \
kingdom in miniature — servants answered your call, tutors shaped your mind, and the \
weight of your family's name opened doors before you ever reached for the handle.

But privilege is a gilded cage. The ledgers your parents pored over told a story of \
declining fortunes, of debts owed to creditors in distant cities. One evening, you \
found your mother's study empty, her signet ring left on the desk beside a letter \
you were never meant to read. The truth it contained set your jaw and steeled your \
resolve.

You took the ring, dressed in your finest, and walked out through the village gates \
at dawn. Whatever comes next, you will face it as your family once faced the world — \
with your chin held high and your name on your lips like a prayer."""

The courts of the Verdant Reach taught you that words are sharper than any sword. \
You learned to read the twitch of an eyebrow, the pause before a lie, the way a \
noble's hand drifts toward their wine when they are about to concede a point. You \
were never the one on the throne — you were the one whispering beside it.

Your position demanded elegance and ruthlessness in equal measure. You brokered \
treaties between feuding families, smoothed over insults that might have started \
wars, and ensured that the right rumor reached the right ears at precisely the right \
moment. Your perfume preceded you into every room, and your reputation followed \
close behind.

Then the court shifted, as courts always do. A new advisor rose, one who saw your \
talents as a threat rather than an asset. You left Thornfield before the knives \
came out — not fleeing, you tell yourself, but repositioning. The wider world is \
simply a larger court, and you intend to master it."""

ring alone. Your family's stall — wedged between a fishmonger and a rope-maker — \
was where you learned that every person carries something they want to sell and \
something they are desperate to buy.

You built your ledger one deal at a time. Silks from the south traded for iron from \
the highlands, potions bartered for passage on coastal ships. The margins were thin, \
but you were thinner — slipping through the gaps that larger traders overlooked. By \
twenty, your name was spoken in the Saltmere Guildhall with a mixture of respect \
and wariness.

But the sea roads grew dangerous, and a shipment you had staked everything on never \
arrived. The ledger that once recorded your triumphs now tallies your losses. You \

Your work spoke for itself — hinges that never rusted, locks that never jammed, \
tools balanced so finely they seemed to anticipate the hand that held them. The \
guild letter in your pocket is both credential and promise: wherever you travel, \
the guild's network of artisans will know you as one of their own.

But a journeyman must journey. The guild expects you to travel, to learn techniques \
from distant forges and foreign workshops, and to return with knowledge that will \

Your letters of introduction bear seals from three different courts. You have \

Now a new assignment calls you beyond the familiar courts. The roads between the \

legend.

You grew up ordinary in Thornfield, or so you believed. But the locket changed \
things. You began to notice patterns — the way certain old texts seemed to make \
sense on instinct, the way your dreams mapped corridors you had never walked. The \
pedigree scroll hints at an inheritance far greater than gold: a legacy of knowledge, \
of duty, of something ancient that chose your bloodline as its vessel.

The solicitor's final words echo in your mind: "When you are ready, the inheritance \
will find you." You are not certain you are ready. But the locket grows warm against \

The details of your exile are complicated — a political betrayal, a forged document, \
allies who proved to be anything but. You replay the final confrontation in your \
mind during sleepless nights, cataloguing every mistake, every sign you should have \
read. The anger has cooled into something harder and more useful: resolve.

You still carry yourself like someone who matters, and in Saltmere, where coin speaks \
louder than pedigree, that counts for something. The dockside traders eye your fine \
