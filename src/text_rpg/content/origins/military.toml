You remember the day the recruiting sergeant came to your village — the gleam of his \
breastplate, the promise of coin and glory. You were young, strong, and foolish enough \
to believe him. Boot camp stripped you of softness. Forced marches, drill formations at \
dawn, the sergeant's boot connecting with your ribs when you stumbled. You learned to \
fight not as an individual, but as a cog in an iron machine.

The wars came and went. You stood in shield walls while arrows darkened the sky. You \
held the line when the man beside you fell screaming. You survived — not through heroism, \
but through discipline, endurance, and a refusal to die in the mud for someone else's \
ambitions.

Now mustered out, you carry your military insignia and little else. Thornfield is quiet — \
a village far from the frontlines. But old instincts die hard. You still wake before dawn. \
You still scan treelines for movement. And you know, with the certainty of a veteran, \
that peace never lasts."""

You knelt on cold stone in a candle-lit chapel, the flat of a blade touching each shoulder \
as the words of investiture echoed off vaulted ceilings. You swore oaths — to defend the \
weak, to uphold justice, to serve a cause greater than yourself. When you rose, you were \
no longer a squire. You were a knight, and the weight of that title settled on you heavier \
than any armor.

For years you served faithfully. You jousted in tournaments, rode with honor guards, and \
dispensed justice in your liege's name. But the realm's politics grew tangled and bitter. \
Your lord fell from favor, your house's lands were seized, and the oaths you swore became \
chains binding you to a cause that no longer existed.

You ride into Thornfield with your signet ring and your honor — the only possessions that \
cannot be taken from you. The fine clothes are threadbare now, but you wear them with the \
bearing of one who has known nobility. Perhaps here, far from courtly intrigues, you can \
find a cause truly worth serving."""

The road is your home — a thousand miles of rutted tracks, muddy passes, and sun-bleached \

merchant caravans through bandit country, driven off wolves in the mountain passes, and \
slept with one eye open in roadside camps where the firelight barely held back the dark.

You have seen the worst the roads have to offer: highwaymen with crossbows in the trees, \
goblin ambushes at narrow bridges, and once, a hill giant that scattered an entire wagon \
train like kindling. You survived because you learned to read the road — the broken \
branch that signals an ambush, the too-quiet forest that means predators are near, the \
dust cloud on the horizon that could be merchants or marauders.

The caravan master paid you off at the farm road outside Thornfield, your contract \
fulfilled. You have a length of rope, the clothes on your back, and a soldier's instincts. \

You have no flag, no lord, no cause — only a price. You have fought on both sides of \

deserved better. The mercenary life is honest in its dishonesty: everyone knows exactly \
where they stand, and it's right next to whoever's paying.

You have run with a dozen different companies over the years. The Red Falcons, who broke \
during the Siege of Karvast. The Iron Tide, who were massacred to the last man at \
Drowner's Ford — except for you, because you had the good sense to run. You learned early \
that loyalty is a luxury and survival is a skill.

Saltmere's docks are full of mercenaries between contracts — scarred men and women \
drinking away their pay, waiting for the next war, the next job, the next excuse to do \

your life was worth more than that. You dropped your shield, picked up your pack, and \
walked into the forest.

They called it desertion. They called it cowardice. You called it the only sane decision \
anyone in that army ever made. But deserters hang, and the military police have long \
memories. You cut your hair, changed your name, and kept moving — always moving, always \
watching for the patrol that might recognize your face from a wanted poster.

The Thornwild swallowed you whole, and you were grateful. The trails here are tangled and \
treacherous, the kind of country that swallows pursuit. You have learned to live lean, to \
build fires that make no smoke, to sleep in thickets where no tracker can follow. It is a \

alchemist's fire. You understood what most soldiers never grasp — that wars are won not by \
the strongest arm, but by the sharpest mind.

The army valued your skills enormously and respected you not at all. Engineers are not \
glamorous. No one writes ballads about the woman who reinforced the gate hinges or the man \
who calculated the correct angle for the siege ramp. But when the walls came down, everyone \
knew whose work had done it.

Cinderhold's forges drew you here — the finest metalwork in the highlands, they said, and \
workshops where a mechanically-minded person could find both work and materials. You arrived \

envied the ones who weren't.

You learned to read the land like a book. Boot prints in soft earth told you troop numbers \
and direction. Broken spider webs at head height meant someone had passed within hours. \
The behavior of birds revealed hidden positions — a flock of starlings that refuses to \
settle marks the spot where soldiers are concealed below. Your compass was your most \
trusted companion, more reliable than any human ally.

The Rangers' Lodge in the Thornwild has become your new home — a gathering place for those \

field hospital after the Battle of Ashenmoor, where the screaming never stopped; the \
village that was already burning when your company arrived too late to save it.

But the war also gave you something — a granite resilience, a bone-deep understanding of \
what truly matters and what is merely noise. You have held dying soldiers in your arms and \
learned to bind wounds by necessity. You have stared death in the face so many times that \
its gaze no longer unsettles you. There is a strength that only comes from surviving what \

Thornfield's inn is quiet, warm, and mercifully free of memories. You sit by the fire with \

product. Promoters decided your fights. Odds-makers set your matches. The crowds loved you \

fighter. You saw it happen to your predecessors — the slow decline, the rigged losses, the \
quiet retirement to obscurity. You chose to leave while the legend was still intact.

insult was a chisel, chipping away weakness to reveal the warrior underneath.

Your superiors valued you because your companies had the lowest casualty rates in the \
regiment. Your recruits hated you with a passion that, in time, quietly transformed into \
grudging respect and then fierce loyalty. Some of them sought you out years later, grizzled \
veterans now, to thank you for being the hardest bastard they ever met — because that \
hardness kept them alive.

Cinderhold's garrison requested an experienced instructor, and the highland air suits you \
