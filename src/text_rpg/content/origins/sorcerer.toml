prologue = """
Your mother tells the story the same way every time: the night you were born, \
lightning struck the Storm Point lighthouse three times in succession, and the \
midwife swore your first cry sounded like thunder. She thought it was a good omen. \
The priests were less certain. Children born during storms are watched closely on \
the Iron Coast — an old superstition that turned out, in your case, to be \
completely justified.

The sparks started when you were seven. Small things at first — static that \
followed you like a pet, candle flames that leaned toward you when you walked past. \
By twelve, you could make your hair stand on end at will. By fifteen, you could \
make other people's hair stand on end without meaning to, which made you unpopular \
at school and very popular during thunderstorms, when the fishermen wanted you on \
the dock because lightning never struck near you. It struck everywhere else.

The control came slowly and is still imperfect. Emotion feeds the storm inside \
you — anger calls lightning to your fingertips, joy makes the air crackle, fear \
makes it rain in a ten-foot radius centered on your head. You have learned to \
breathe through the surges, to channel rather than suppress, but you are a long \
way from mastery. The storm is patient. You are learning to be."""

prologue = """
The scales appeared on your sixteenth birthday. Small ones, barely visible, running \
along the backs of your hands like a fine metallic rash. Your family physician \
called it a skin condition. Your grandmother called it the blood waking up. She \
had always claimed the family line traced back to a union between a human ancestor \
and a brass dragon — a story everyone dismissed as senile fantasy until your hands \
started glinting gold in the sunlight.

The power followed the scales. Fire, mostly — a warmth that built in your palms \
until you had to release it or burn. You set the family stable on fire the first \
time, which was an accident. The second time was also an accident. The third time, \
you were aiming at a practice target and hit it dead center from thirty paces, \
which was when your grandmother said "I told you so" and your father said "please \
leave before you burn down the house."

You walk the highlands now with scales on your hands and fire in your blood, \
learning through trial and error what your ancestors knew instinctively. The \
draconic heritage is awakening in stages — each new ability arriving unannounced \
and requiring urgent mastery before it masters you. Somewhere in the world, there \
must be someone who understands this gift. Until you find them, you practice."""

summary = "Exposed to raw wild magic as a child, reality bends unpredictably around you."
prologue = """
Nobody knows what the thing in the old ruins was. The scholars called it a "wild \
magic nexus" — a tear in the fabric of reality where raw, unfiltered magical energy \
bleeds into the physical world. You called it "the shiny thing in the basement," \
because you were eight years old and it was glowing and you touched it before \
anyone could stop you.

The next three days are a blur. Your parents describe flying furniture, color-changing \
walls, gravity reversing in the kitchen, and a memorable incident where the family \
cat temporarily became a small tree. You remember none of it. What you remember is \
waking up in your bed with the taste of copper in your mouth and the certain \
knowledge that the world was not as solid as everyone pretended.

The chaos has become manageable. Mostly. You have learned to direct the wild magic \
rather than simply emit it, though there are still moments when your spells do \
something unexpected — a fire bolt that turns blue, a shield spell that makes \
flowers grow, a healing touch that leaves the patient's hair a different color. \
The unpredictability is the price. The power is the payment. You are learning to \
accept both."""

prologue = """
The deep mines beneath Cinderhold touch places that are not entirely part of this \
world. The miners know it — they speak of warm spots where the rock pulses like a \
heartbeat, and cold spots where your breath freezes in midsummer. You were born \
in the mining settlement, daughter of a foreman and a cook, and you grew up \
playing in tunnels that stretched down to where the elemental planes press \
against the skin of reality.

The first time you pulled fire from the air without a spark or a gesture, you were \
thirteen and standing in one of those warm spots. The fire did not burn you. It \
circled your hand like a tame animal, responding to your will with an eagerness \
that bordered on affection. You tried it with the cold spots next. Ice formed \
between your fingers, crackling and blue and absolutely obedient.

The miners' guild asked you to leave after you accidentally collapsed a tunnel \
by pulling too much thermal energy from the surrounding rock. The stone became \
brittle with cold and the ceiling came down. No one was hurt, but the message \
was clear: your gift and their livelihood are not compatible. You walk the \
highlands with elemental fire in one hand and elemental cold in the other, \
seeking balance between forces that do not naturally coexist."""

You were nobody. A fishmonger's assistant in Saltmere, scaling cod and haggling \
over prices and dreaming of nothing more ambitious than owning your own stall \
someday. Magic was something wizards did — people who spent decades in towers \
reading books you could not afford. It had nothing to do with you.

Then the wave hit. A rogue swell during what should have been a calm morning, \
tall enough to swallow the docks whole. You saw it coming. You saw the children \
playing on the pier. And something inside you — something that had been sleeping \
since birth, coiled in your chest like a dormant seed — erupted. You raised your \
hands and the wave split around the pier like a river around a stone. The children \
were dry. The dock was dry. You collapsed and woke up three days later with a \
nosebleed and a crowd of people who wanted to know how you did it.

You do not know how you did it. The power is still there — you can feel it \
humming behind your breastbone, eager and terrifying and utterly without \
instruction. No one in Saltmere can teach you to control it. The wizards' guild \
wants to study you like a specimen. The only sensible option is to find someone \
who understands what you are before you accidentally split something larger than \
a wave."""
