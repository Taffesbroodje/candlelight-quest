The farm road south of Thornfield is rutted deep by generations of cart wheels, and \
your boots have worn their own groove into it. You know every stone, every puddle \
that forms after rain, every bend where the wind shifts and carries the smell of \
turned earth. The farm was your father's before you, and his mother's before him, \
and the soil remembers their hands as surely as it knows yours.

You rose before dawn and worked until the light failed. Planting, harvesting, \
mending fences, chasing crows, pulling stones from fields that seemed to grow them \
like crops. Your hands are maps of labor — calloused palms, a crooked finger that \
healed wrong after a kicked gate, dirt under your nails that no amount of scrubbing \
ever fully removes. It was honest work, and you were proud of it.

But the blight came with the autumn rains. Black rot crept through the wheat, \
spread to the barley, and by the first frost, the harvest was a fraction of what \
you needed. The debts mounted. The farm could not sustain you through winter, and \
you would not watch your family starve while you clung to pride. You sharpened your \
shovel, packed what provisions remained, and set out along the farm road — this \
time walking away from everything you knew, toward whatever might save it."""

Cinderhold's forges never sleep. The mountain city breathes smoke and rings with \
hammers at every hour, its foundries fed by veins of ore that run through the rock \
like dark arteries. You apprenticed in the lower forges where the heat was fiercest \
and the masters were hardest, learning to read the color of heated steel the way \
a scholar reads text — cherry red for bending, white for welding, the faintest \
blue that warns of brittleness.

Your arms grew thick from the work, your lungs accustomed to the acrid air, your \
ears tuned to the pitch of a hammer strike that tells you whether the metal will \
hold or shatter. You forged nails by the thousand, then hinges, then blades. Each \
piece carried your mark — a small notch on the tang that the masters taught you to \
be proud of, because a blacksmith who will not sign their work does not trust it.

But the deep mines have grown dangerous. Ore shipments slowed, then stopped. The \
forges that once blazed around the clock now stand cold for hours at a time, and \
the younger smiths have begun drifting away to seek work elsewhere. You could stay \
and wait for the ore to return. Instead, you packed your tools and descended the \
highland road, carrying the forge's heat in your blood and its discipline in your \
bones. Whatever lies ahead, you will shape it to your will."""

The Iron Coast earned its name from the color of its cliffs, but you know a truer \

touches into unyielding shape. You signed on to your first crew at fourteen, a \
scrawny thing hauling rope on a merchant vessel that ran the coastal routes between \
Saltmere and ports you have since forgotten. The sea did not care that you were \
young. It taught you balance, strength, and the absolute necessity of trusting the \
person beside you when a storm turns the world to chaos.

You learned to read the sky like a letter — high cirrus for fair weather, a green \
tinge on the horizon for trouble, the particular stillness before a squall that \
makes experienced sailors check the rigging without a word. Your hands know every \
knot. Your feet know every pitch and roll. You have been thrown overboard twice and \
survived both times, which earns a kind of respect among sailors that no title can \
match.

But the last voyage ended badly. The ship struck something — rock, reef, or \
something worse — and went down in the tide caves south of Saltmere. You swam to \
shore with nothing but the rope on your belt and the navigator's tools you grabbed \
as the deck tilted. Now you stand on the docks, dripping and determined, ready to \

Fisher's Cove is a crescent of grey sand sheltered from the worst of the Iron \
Coast's storms by a natural breakwater of tumbled stone. You have launched your \
boat from this beach more times than you can count, rowing out before dawn into \
water the color of pewter, setting your lines where the currents converge and the \
fish school thick beneath the surface. The cove taught you patience — the deep, \
bone-still patience of someone who knows that the sea gives when it chooses, not \
when you demand.

You learned the water's moods. The tides that bring schools of silver-sided bass, \
the currents that pull jellyfish inshore, the rare days when the water clears \
enough to see the kelp forests swaying twenty feet below your hull. You read the \
surface for the dimples that betray feeding fish and the sky for the birds that \
mark where the shoals run.

But the fish have been thinning. Each season the catch is smaller, the good spots \
farther from shore, the competition among the cove's fishers sharper and less \
friendly. Last week you hauled your nets and found them full of nothing but weed \
and a strange, pale mud that smelled of rot. Something has changed in the waters, \
and the old fishers mutter about the sunken temple to the south. You mended your \
nets one final time, stored your boat, and turned your back on the cove to find \

The deep mines beneath the Ashen Highlands are older than Cinderhold itself. The \
earliest shafts were carved by hands that left no other record — only tunnels so \
precisely cut that modern miners still follow them, marveling at the geometry. You \
have spent years in those tunnels, chipping ore from seams of copper and iron, \
breathing dust that coats your lungs and grits between your teeth. The darkness \
down there is absolute, a weight you can feel against your skin, and your lantern \
is your most precious possession.

You learned to read the stone the way surface folk read weather — the sound of a \
tap that warns of hollow ground, the mineral streaks that promise rich veins, the \
subtle shifts in air pressure that mean a passage connects to something larger. \
Your pick found more than ore. You uncovered fossils pressed into the rock like \
prayers, veins of crystal that hummed when struck, and once, a sealed chamber \
filled with air so cold your lantern nearly died.

That chamber is what drove you to the surface. What you saw inside — the carvings, \
the symbols, the thing resting on its pedestal — was not meant for a miner's eyes. \
You reported it to the foreman, who reported it to the guild, who sealed the shaft \
and told you to forget. But you cannot forget. The symbols glow behind your closed \
eyes at night, and the pick in your hand feels less like a tool and more like a key."""

The Thornwild does not welcome visitors, but it tolerates those who understand it. \
You learned its language young — the creak of a healthy trunk versus the groan of \
rot, the difference between wind in the canopy and something moving through it, the \
tracks that mean deer and the tracks that mean you should turn back. Your axe has \
felled oaks that were old when your grandparents were born, and each one taught you \
something: where to cut, when to step clear, how to read the lean.

The trails through the Thornwild were your daily commute. You walked them in fog \
and rain, in the green haze of summer and the skeletal grey of winter. You know \
which clearings catch the morning light and which hollows stay damp enough to \
cultivate mushrooms. The forest provided everything — timber for trade, kindling \
for warmth, game when the hunting was good, and silence when you needed it most.

But the forest has been restless lately. Trees you marked for felling have vanished \
overnight, their stumps smooth as if they were never cut. The trails shift when \
you are not watching. Last month, you found your axe marks on a tree you had never \
touched, deep cuts healed over with new bark that should have taken years to grow. \

Skittish mares calmed under your hand. Ill-tempered stallions ate from your palm. \
The stable master noticed, and within a season, you were handling every horse that \
passed through Thornfield.

You learned to read animals the way their owners wished they could — the ear \
position that warns of a kick, the restless circling that means colic, the way a \
horse's eyes widen just before it bolts. You could calm a panicked animal in a \
thunderstorm, diagnose a limp by watching a trot, and predict the weather by \
which corner of the paddock the old grey mare chose to stand in.

But last week a merchant's horse arrived lathered and wild-eyed, its rider missing, \
its saddlebags slashed open and emptied. The animal bore claw marks on its flank \
that you could not identify — too wide for a wolf, too clean for a bear. You \
treated the wounds, soothed the horse, and lay awake that night listening to the \
wind beyond the stable walls. The roads are growing dangerous. The animals know it \

What you notice instead is the quality of a hide: its thickness, its grain, the way \
it takes to the tanning liquor. A good tanner can turn a raw pelt into leather that \
will outlast the animal it came from by a century, and you are a very good tanner.

The work is unglamorous and endless. Scraping flesh, soaking hides, stretching and \
drying and oiling until your arms ache and your fingers prune. But there is a \
satisfaction in it — in watching a stiff, bloody skin transform into something \
supple and strong, something that will become a belt, a boot, armor that might save \
a life. You know the hides of every animal in the region by touch alone, and the \
hunters who supply you trust your assessment of their pelts more than their own.

Business has shifted recently. The hunters bring fewer pelts and stranger stories — \
creatures in the Whisperwood that leave hides no one can identify, tracks in the \
mud that match nothing in your experience. One hunter brought you a scrap of hide \

The tavern in Cinderhold sits at the junction of three mine roads, which means it \

brewmaster, a woman whose ales were famous from the highlands to the coast. She \
taught you that brewing is alchemy for practical folk — the right grain, the right \
water, the right yeast, and the patience to let time do its work while you resist \
the urge to meddle.

You experimented endlessly. Highland barley steeped with juniper berries. A dark \
stout aged in barrels that once held sulfur spring water, giving it a mineral bite \
that miners craved after long shifts underground. A honey mead so smooth that the \
Cinderhold forgemasters used it to seal trade deals, claiming no one could argue \
after a second cup. Your recipes filled a leather-bound notebook that you guard \
more carefully than gold.

The old brewmaster passed last winter, and the tavern's new owner has different \
ideas about the craft — cheaper ingredients, faster batches, quantity over quality. \
You argued. You lost. You packed your notebook, your supplies, and your dignity, \
and walked out of the tavern where you had spent the best years of your life. The \
road stretches ahead, and every town has a tavern. Somewhere out there is a place \

Cinderhold's walls have stood for three hundred years, and every mason in the city \

You learned to see the difference as a young apprentice, running your fingers along \
the seams between blocks, feeling for the precision that separates craft from mere \
construction. The stone of the Ashen Highlands is volcanic — hard, dark, and \
unforgiving of mistakes. You broke a dozen chisels before you learned to let the \
stone guide the cut rather than forcing your will upon it.

Your hands built the new gatehouse at Cinderhold Gate, fitted so tightly that a \
knife blade cannot slip between the joints. You repaired the ancient stairs to the \
Obsidian Plateau, matching the original work so closely that the guild inspector \
could not find the seam. Your eye for structural integrity is unerring — one glance \
at a wall tells you whether it will stand another century or collapse next winter.

But the recent tremors from the deep mines have cracked foundations that should have \
been unbreakable. You were called to assess the damage and found something disturbing: \
the cracks follow patterns too regular to be natural. They trace lines through the \
stone like writing in a language you almost recognize. The guild dismissed your \

better than any human speech. A shepherd's life is solitary, and you learned to find \
company in the rhythm of the seasons — lambing in spring, shearing in summer, the \
long watches of autumn when the predators grow bold.

You know every hollow where a ewe might lamb in secret, every stream crossing safe \
for the flock, every ridge where the wind carries sounds from miles away. Your ears \

silence that means something worse. You have faced down foxes with your crook and \

nothing but stubbornness and a whistle.

But this past season, the losses have been different. Sheep vanishing without blood, \
without tracks, without the wool-snagged-on-brambles trail that even the cleverest \
predator leaves behind. Three ewes gone from a flock you watched all night, as if \
