prologue = """
The elders painted the exile mark across your brow before dawn, while the fires still crackled \
low and the rest of the tribe pretended to sleep. You had broken no law they could name aloud — \
your crime was simpler than that. You were too human for the war-songs, too orcish for the \
peace-prayers. The shaman pressed a beast trophy into your hand, the jawbone of the dire wolf \
you felled at thirteen summers. "Remember what you are," she said. You are still deciding what \
that means.

The thornwild trails have been your home since. You sleep in the hollows between gnarled roots, \
drink from streams that taste of iron and moss, and speak to no one for days at a stretch. The \
forest tests you constantly — poisonous thorns, territorial beasts, ground that shifts beneath \
your feet — but it never judges you. Out here, strength and cunning are the only currencies \
that matter. You have plenty of both.

Lately the trails have grown stranger. Tracks you cannot identify press deep into the mud. \
Birds fall silent in places where silence has no business being. Something is changing in the \
thornwild, and you feel it in your bones the way you once felt the tribe's war-drums through \
the earth. Whatever comes, you will face it as you have faced everything else — alone, and \
without flinching."""

category = "half_orc"
summary = "You clawed your way to fame in Saltmere's brutal fighting pits, where blood buys glory and glory buys freedom."
prologue = """
They dragged you into the pits when you were barely old enough to hold a weapon. Some debt your \
mother owed, some arrangement made in desperation — the details blur together now beneath the \
weight of a hundred fights. What you remember is the roar. That sound, rising from the throats \
of sailors and merchants and thieves packed shoulder to shoulder around the sand circle, became \
the only applause you ever needed. You learned to fight not with the disciplined forms of a \
soldier, but with the savage creativity of someone who understands that losing means dying.

The trophy medal hanging from your neck is tin and copper, worth almost nothing, but it marks \
you as the last undefeated champion of the Saltmere dockside pits. You won it by defeating a \
scarred bugbear called Gorethusk in a match that lasted nearly an hour. When you finally stood \
over his broken body, chest heaving, blood running from a dozen wounds, the pit-master offered \
you a contract. More fights. More gold. More glory. You walked out instead. Freedom, you \
decided, was worth more than fame.

Now you wander the docks of Saltmere, a free half-orc with a reputation that precedes you into \
every tavern. Some want to hire your fists. Others want to test them. The salt wind carries the \
smell of opportunity, and for the first time in your life, you get to choose which doors to \
walk through."""

summary = "Raised at the crossroads of orc and human culture, you have learned to speak the language of both worlds."
prologue = """
Your mother was human, a diplomat's daughter who fell in love with an orc chieftain during a \
treaty negotiation that was never meant to produce anything lasting. But you lasted. You grew \
up splitting your years between your mother's quiet stone house in Thornfield and your father's \
hide tent in the war-camps to the north, learning to hold a quill in one hand and a javelin in \
the other. Neither world fully accepted you, but both needed you. When tensions rose, when the \
old hatreds flared between orc and human, they sent for you. The half-blood. The one who could \
see both sides.

You wear an amulet of passage around your neck, a disc of carved bone and hammered silver that \
bears both the orcish rune for "kin" and the human seal of Thornfield. Your father made the \
bone half; your mother commissioned the silver. It marks you as welcome in places where most \
half-orcs would be met with drawn swords. More than that, it reminds you of what you represent: \
the fragile possibility that these two peoples might someday see each other clearly.

You have returned to Thornfield now, drawn by rumors of new conflicts brewing in the \
surrounding wilds. The village is smaller than you remember, its people more frightened. They \
look at you with a mixture of hope and suspicion that you have learned to read as fluently as \
any language. There is work to be done here — the work that only someone who belongs to both \
worlds, and therefore neither, can do."""

id = "war_shaman_apprentice"
name = "War Shaman Apprentice"
category = "half_orc"
summary = "Chosen by the tribe's war shaman to learn the old spirit-ways, you walk the line between healer and destroyer."
prologue = """
The war shaman chose you on the night of the blood moon, when the spirits pressed close to the \
world and the boundary between flesh and ghost grew thin as smoke. You were twelve, gangly and \
unsure of your own strength, when the old orc pointed one gnarled finger at you across the \
fire and spoke the words of binding. Your parents wept — whether from pride or grief, you never \
asked. From that night forward, you belonged to the spirits.

The training was brutal and strange. You learned to set bones and brew poultices from roots \
that grew only in places where blood had been spilled. You learned the names of the ancestor \
spirits and the precise offerings each demanded. You learned to read the future in the patterns \
of cracked bones and spilled entrails, and to call upon the old powers when the tribe rode to \
war. The war shaman taught you that healing and violence are not opposites but partners — that \
the same hand must know how to mend a wound and how to inflict one.

Your master is dead now, taken by a fever that even the spirits could not cure. Before the end, \
she sent you south to Briarhaven Grove, where the boundary between worlds is thinnest and the \
old powers still linger in the roots of ancient trees. "Finish your training," she rasped, \
pressing her herbalism kit into your hands. "The spirits have plans for you that even I cannot \
see." You kneel among the twisted roots and listen for their voices."""

id = "redeemed_raider"
name = "Redeemed Raider"
category = "half_orc"
summary = "Once part of a warband that terrorized the frontier, you abandoned the raider's life after witnessing an act of cruelty you could not stomach."
prologue = """
You rode with the Blackfang warband for three years, long enough for the smoke of burning \
homesteads to stop bothering your eyes and the screaming to fade into background noise. You \
told yourself it was survival. You told yourself the humans would do the same if they had the \
strength. You told yourself a lot of things in those years, and most of them were lies. The \
truth caught up with you on a cold autumn night when the warband chief ordered the execution of \
prisoners — farmers, mostly, and their children. Something inside you, something you thought \
the raids had killed, refused.

You fought your way out. The scars on your back are from orcish blades, not human ones. You \
ran south through the night with nothing but the clothes on your back and a military insignia \
torn from the warband chief's tent — proof, if you ever needed it, of what you had been part \
of. For weeks you wandered, sleeping in ditches, flinching at every sound. The Blackfangs \
would kill you on sight. Most human settlements would do the same, seeing only the green skin \
and the tusks and assuming the worst.

Thornfield Inn took you in. The innkeeper, a grizzled veteran who had seen enough of the world \
to judge people by their actions rather than their blood, offered you a room in exchange for \
work. You chop wood, haul kegs, and break up the occasional bar fight. The regulars have grown \
used to you, though trust comes slowly. You do not blame them. Trust should come slowly. You \
are still earning yours."""

id = "bloodsworn_protector"
name = "Bloodsworn Protector"
category = "half_orc"
summary = "Bound by a blood oath to defend the mountain holds, you stand as a living wall between the deep dark and the people above."
prologue = """
The blood oath was your choice, though some would call it madness. When the dwarf-lords of \
Cinderhold called for volunteers to seal the breach in the deep mines — the one that had been \
vomiting creatures from the underdark for three straight months — you stepped forward. Not for \
gold. Not for glory. Because someone had to, and you were tired of watching smaller, frailer \
people throw themselves into the dark while you stood safely behind the gate. The ritual was \
ancient, older than the hold itself: a cut across both palms, blood mingled with the mountain's \
iron-rich water, and words spoken in a language that made your teeth ache. When it was done, you \
could feel the mountain's heartbeat in your bones.

You held that breach for eleven days. Eleven days of darkness and screaming and things with too \
many legs pressing against your shield. The dwarves fought beside you — brave, stubborn, \
relentless — and slowly you earned something that half-orcs rarely receive from the mountain \
folk: respect. When the breach was finally sealed with molten slag and divine wards, the \
hold-master clasped your arm and called you kin. It was the first time anyone had used that \
word without it feeling like a lie.

Now you stand watch at Cinderhold's gate, a length of hempen rope coiled at your belt for the \
climbs between guard posts, your eyes always turned toward the dark. The breach is sealed, but \
the mountain remembers what came through it. And you have sworn — in blood, in iron, in the \
old words — that nothing will breach these walls again while you still draw breath."""

id = "rage_channeler"
name = "Rage Channeler"
category = "half_orc"
summary = "Where others fear the orcish fury in your blood, you have learned to harness it as a weapon and a meditation."
prologue = """
The rages started when you were young — blinding, volcanic eruptions of fury that left you \
standing in the wreckage of whatever you had just destroyed, shaking and sick with shame. Your \
human neighbors called you a monster. Your orcish kin called you blessed. Neither understood \
what it felt like from the inside: the fire in your skull, the way the world narrowed to a red \
tunnel, the terrifying joy of absolute destruction. You hurt people you loved. You broke things \
that could not be mended. By the time you were sixteen, you had resigned yourself to a life \
spent either in chains or alone on the road.

Then you found the highland hermit. An ancient half-orc covered in ritual tattoos, living in a \
cave above the sulfur springs where the air tasted of brimstone and old magic. She took one \
look at you and laughed — a sound like rocks grinding together. "You think the rage is your \
enemy," she said, heating her tattoo needles over the fire. "It is not. It is you. The part of \
you that refuses to be small." She taught you the channeling ways: breathing patterns that \
could bank the fire without extinguishing it, meditation forms that let you touch the edge of \
fury without falling in, and the sacred tattoos that served as anchors for the spirit when the \
rage threatened to sweep everything else away.

The hermit is gone now, vanished into the highlands as suddenly as she appeared. She left you \
her tattoo needles and a beast trophy — the skull-cap of a highland ram she killed with her \
bare hands in her hundredth year. You walk the highland road with the rage coiled inside you \
like a banked furnace, controlled but never tamed. You do not fear it anymore. You have learned \
that the fire does not need to consume you. It can illuminate instead."""
