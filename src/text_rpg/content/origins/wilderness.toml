You left the world behind — its noise, its cruelty, its endless petty demands. You walked \
into the Thornwild with nothing but a satchel of herbs and a desperate need for silence, \
and the forest accepted you. For years you lived alone among the ancient trees, learning \
the language of moss and rainfall, studying the medicinal properties of every root and \
flower, and sitting in meditations so deep that the animals forgot to fear you.

In that solitude, something shifted. Call it enlightenment, call it madness — the boundary \
is thinner than most people realize. You began to see patterns in the growth of lichen on \
stone, to hear whispers in the wind that might have been the voice of something vast and \
patient. You wrote your revelations on bark with charcoal, filling the walls of your \
shelter with cramped, feverish notes that you alone could decipher.

Now something has drawn you back toward the world of people. A vision, perhaps, or simply \
the realization that a truth kept in isolation helps no one. The grove near Briarhaven is \
as close to civilization as you are willing to venture for now — close enough to observe, \
far enough to retreat. You carry your herbalism kit and your hard-won wisdom, blinking in \
the unfamiliar light of human company."""

You were born beyond the borders of civilization, in a place where the map simply reads \
"here be monsters." Your family — if you had one — lived off the land, migrating with the \
seasons, hunting what the forest provided, and sheltering in caves when the storms came. \
You learned to track before you could read. You could start a fire with wet wood and \
build a shelter from pine boughs before you were ten years old.

The wild is not cruel, not kind — it simply is. It has tried to kill you a hundred times \
through exposure, starvation, predators, and flash floods, and each time you survived by \
being tougher, smarter, or luckier than the thing trying to end you. You wear the lessons \
on your skin: the frostbite scars on your fingers, the claw marks on your shoulder, the \
permanent squint from a lifetime of scanning horizons.

The Thornwild trails feel like home — tangled, dangerous, and honest. You came to the \
edges of settled land because the deep wilderness is growing strange. Animal migrations are \
shifting. Predators are moving into territories they have never claimed before. Something \
is wrong in the wild places, and you mean to find out what."""

Patience. That is the hunter's first and greatest virtue. You have lain motionless in \
undergrowth for hours, barely breathing, waiting for the heartbeat when a stag steps into \
the clearing. You have followed deer trails through dense forest for days, reading bent \
twigs and scuffed earth like pages of a book. The kill, when it comes, is almost an \
afterthought — the culmination of a long, quiet conversation between predator and prey.

Your traps are works of art — snares set with mathematical precision, deadfalls balanced \
so delicately that a rabbit's footstep triggers them. You know which bait draws which \
quarry, which trails are active by season, which watering holes the elk favor when the \
mountain streams run dry. The forest is your larder, and you have never gone hungry.

The Rangers' Lodge welcomed you as one of their own. Hunters are respected here in the \
Thornwild — providers, not sport-killers. Your rope and your traps are the tools of a \
trade you have practiced since childhood, and the forest around the lodge is rich with \
game. But lately, the animals have been skittish. Something is disturbing the old patterns, \
and a hunter's instinct tells you that whatever it is, it's no ordinary predator."""

The oath you swore was not to a king or a lord, but to the land itself. You are a ranger — \

the deep woods. You patrol the border trails alone, marking safe passages, clearing monster \
dens, and leaving warnings carved into trees for those who might wander too far from the \
firelight.

It is thankless work. The villages you protect barely know you exist. You pass through \
like a shadow, leaving nothing but boot prints and the occasional slain goblin on their \
doorstep. When a farmer's livestock stops disappearing, he thanks the gods, not the ranger \
who tracked the worg to its lair and put an arrow through its eye at forty paces. You \
have made your peace with anonymity. The compass guides your path, and the wild is your \
only witness.

The Rangers' Lodge is the closest thing you have to a home — a rough-hewn outpost where \
wardens gather to share intelligence and resupply before melting back into the forest. You \
arrived yesterday with troubling news: the fey crossing to the north is growing active, \
and strange creatures have been sighted on trails that were safe a month ago. The other \
rangers listen grimly. Something is stirring."""

Feverfew for headaches, willow bark for pain, comfrey for broken bones — the green \

your childhood grinding poultices and brewing bitter teas in her cottage, learning which \
roots to dig by moonlight and which mushrooms would kill with a single bite.

When she died, the village turned to you. Farmers' wives brought feverish children to your \
door. Woodcutters arrived with infected wounds. You treated them all — sometimes with herbs, \
sometimes with honey and clean bandages, and sometimes with nothing but reassuring words \
when the sickness was beyond your skill. You were no miracle worker, but you were all they \
had, and you took that responsibility as seriously as any oath.

Briarhaven's fields and forests are rich with medicinal plants, many of which you have \
never seen before. The village welcomed you warmly — a traveling herbalist is always needed \

Your people have no word for "home" — or rather, every place is home and none is. You were \

summer pastures and winter camps. Your tribe follows routes older than any kingdom, carved \
into collective memory through songs and stories passed down through generations. You know \
which valleys flood in spring, which mountain passes close in winter, and which watering \
holes never run dry.

The settled folk call your people vagrants, thieves, trespassers. They build their stone \
walls and plant their fence posts and pretend they own the earth. You pity them. They \
have traded freedom for the illusion of security, chained themselves to a single patch of \
dirt, and called it civilization. Your people understand what they have forgotten: the \
world is vast, and it belongs to those brave enough to walk it.

The highland road through the Ashen Highlands is one of the old routes — your grandmother \
sang of it when you were small. But your clan scattered last winter after a dispute with a \

The swamp is not a wasteland — it is a world unto itself, teeming with life that the \

cypress trees and the smell of the wind. You know which patches of solid-looking ground \
are actually bottomless muck, which lily pads hide venomous serpents, and which still pools \
are safe to drink and which will twist your guts into knots.

Outsiders fear the marsh. They see rot, disease, and desolation. You see abundance. The \
swamp gives catfish and crawfish, tubers that grow thick in the mud, medicinal mosses that \
no apothecary could afford. It gives alligator hide for boots, reed for baskets, and peat \
for fuel. You have never gone hungry, never gone cold, and never envied the comfortable \
ignorance of people who live on solid ground.

Merchants, pilgrims, and adventurers have paid well for your expertise. You have led \
caravans over passes that would have buried them in avalanches without your guidance. You \

handhold on the cliff faces, every shelter cave where a party can wait out a blizzard, \
every treacherous ice bridge that looks solid but will crack under the weight of a loaded \
mule.

The Ashen Highlands are your mountains — volcanic, unstable, and magnificent. The highland \

Your gift has practical applications. You have calmed panicked horses, coaxed venomous \
snakes away from campsites, and once convinced a territorial owlbear to relocate its den \
rather than eat a logging crew. People call it magic, but it isn't — it is empathy and \
patience, the willingness to see the world through eyes that are not your own. The trophy \

dangerous creatures respond to understanding.

somehow — sand under your fingers and air in your chest. You crawled onto a rocky shore \

Days blurred together. You ate shellfish pried from rocks with bleeding fingers. You drank \
rainwater collected in a hollow stone. You built a fire with trembling hands and a stolen \
minute of sunshine through a cracked lens. The rope you salvaged from the wreckage became \
your most precious possession — shelter cordage, fishing line, snare wire, tourniquet. You \
