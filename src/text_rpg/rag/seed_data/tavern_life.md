# Tavern Life

## Common Tavern Layouts and Atmospheres

The common room is the heart of any tavern, a large open space dominated by a long bar counter and filled with an assortment of tables, benches, and chairs in varying states of repair. A massive stone fireplace occupies one wall, large enough to roast a whole pig on feast days and warm enough to dry a soaked traveler standing ten feet away. The floor is packed earth or rough-hewn planks, scattered with rushes or sawdust to absorb spilled drinks and muddy bootprints.

Light in a tavern comes from tallow candles stuck in iron holders, oil lamps hanging from ceiling beams, and the ever-present glow of the hearth fire. The resulting illumination is warm but uneven, creating pools of golden light at tables and deep shadows in corners -- an arrangement that suits both the romantic and the secretive. Smoke from the fire, candles, and pipes of the patrons hangs in blue-grey layers near the ceiling, giving the air a hazy, dreamlike quality.

The bar counter is the domain of the tavernkeeper, a scarred and polished plank of oak or ironwood behind which shelves hold ranks of bottles, casks, and mugs. The space behind the bar is organized with the efficiency of a battle plan: common ales within easy reach, expensive spirits on higher shelves, and a cudgel or short sword tucked discreetly beneath the counter for those occasions when diplomacy fails.

Upstairs rooms in a tavern range from shared dormitories where travelers sleep shoulder to shoulder on straw pallets to private rooms with actual beds, washbasins, and doors that lock. The quality of the accommodations correlates directly with the quality of the establishment and the weight of the guest purse. Even the finest tavern room is modest by noble standards, but to a road-weary adventurer, a private room with a real mattress and a basin of warm water feels like a palace.

## Types of Patrons and Their Stories

Regulars form the backbone of any tavern community. These are the locals who occupy the same seats every evening, nursing their ale and exchanging the day news with the comfort of long familiarity. The blacksmith, the miller, the retired guardsman, the widowed herbalist -- each has their accustomed place and their accustomed drink, and the tavernkeeper who fails to have both ready earns a look of deep reproach.

Merchants and traders pass through in a steady stream, their moods rising and falling with the fortunes of the road. A merchant who has just concluded a profitable deal buys rounds for the house and tells expansive stories of far-off markets. One who has been robbed by bandits or cheated by a dishonest partner sits in a dark corner, nursing cheap ale and dark thoughts. Both are valuable sources of information about conditions on the roads and in distant towns.

Adventurers are the most colorful and least predictable tavern patrons. They arrive in mismatched groups of armored fighters, robed spellcasters, and leather-clad rogues, speaking too loudly about their latest exploits and spending gold with the reckless abandon of people who might not be alive next week. Tavernkeepers have a complicated relationship with adventurers: they spend freely but attract trouble, tell fascinating stories but sometimes turn out to be the trouble themselves.

Shady characters occupy the dimly lit corners and back booths of every tavern worth its salt. Information brokers, fence operators, contract negotiators, and outright criminals conduct their business in murmured conversations over untouched drinks. The tavernkeeper sees everything and says nothing, understanding that discretion is essential to maintaining the delicate ecosystem that keeps coin flowing and blood off the floor.

## Bar Games and Entertainment

Darts is the universal tavern game, requiring nothing more than a board, a set of darts, and enough wall space to accommodate the occasional wild throw. Tavern dart leagues are serious business in many towns, with seasonal competitions that draw spectators and wagering in equal measure. The best dart throwers are local celebrities, and a challenge match between rivals from different taverns can pack the house to the rafters.

Card games run the gamut from innocent pastimes to high-stakes gambling that has cost more than one patron their life savings. Three-Dragon Ante is the most popular card game across the realm, a blend of strategy and bluffing that rewards both cunning play and psychological warfare. Tables of dedicated card players form their own micro-communities within the tavern, complete with running rivalries, house rules, and unwritten codes of conduct.

Arm wrestling is the favored contest of strength, requiring no equipment and settling arguments about physical prowess in seconds. A scarred and pitted table in the corner of many taverns serves as the permanent arm-wrestling station, its surface worn smooth by thousands of contested matches. Challenges are issued and accepted with a ritual formality that belies the simplicity of the contest, and side bets spring up faster than the competitors can clasp hands.

Live entertainment transforms a tavern from a drinking establishment into a gathering place for the community. Traveling bards are the most prized performers, bringing songs, stories, and news from distant lands. A skilled bard can hold an entire tavern in rapt silence with a well-told tale or have the whole room singing along to a familiar ballad. Local musicians also perform, from the farmer who plays a passable fiddle to the retired soldier whose war songs bring tears to the eyes of fellow veterans.

## Rumors and Quest Hooks

Every tavern is a clearing house for rumors, gossip, and half-truths that circulate through the community like blood through veins. The tavernkeeper hears everything -- whispered confessions, shouted boasts, drunken revelations, and careful negotiations -- and filters this torrent of information with practiced skill. Those who earn the tavernkeeper trust may find themselves steered toward useful intelligence; those who do not may find themselves steered toward carefully constructed misinformation.

Quest hooks emerge naturally from tavern conversation. A farmer mentions that his livestock have been disappearing, taken by something that leaves claw marks on the barn door. A merchant needs guards for a caravan heading through bandit territory. A noblewoman seeks discrete investigators to look into her missing brother. These requests are rarely posted on a notice board; they arise from overheard conversations, direct approaches to likely-looking adventurers, and the subtle machinations of the tavernkeeper who knows exactly which patron needs what and is willing to make introductions for a modest fee.

The accuracy of tavern rumors follows a rough bell curve. Most contain a kernel of truth wrapped in layers of exaggeration, misunderstanding, and creative embellishment. The goblin raiding party of twenty that a terrified farmer reported might actually be six goblins led by a hobgoblin captain. The dragon sighted over the northern mountains might be a wyvern, or even a large bird seen at an unfortunate distance. Skilled adventurers learn to triangulate rumors from multiple sources, looking for consistent details across different accounts.

Some rumors are deliberately planted by interested parties. A thieves guild might spread word of a valuable shipment taking a specific route, hoping to lure rival gangs into an ambush. A local lord might quietly encourage stories of haunting in a particular ruin to keep commoners away from a secret he wants hidden. The most dangerous rumors are those that are entirely true but sound too good -- or too terrible -- to be believed.

## Food and Drink Descriptions

The house ale is the foundation upon which every tavern is built. Brewed on the premises or sourced from a local brewery, it is the cheapest and most popular drink, served in heavy ceramic mugs or wooden tankards. Good house ale is nutty and full-bodied, with enough bitterness to cut through the richness of tavern food. Bad house ale is thin, sour, and suspiciously cloudy, but still preferable to untreated water in most settlements.

Wine in a tavern ranges from rough table wine sold by the pitcher to carefully cellared vintages that the tavernkeeper reserves for special customers. Red wines from southern vineyards pair with the heavy stews and roasted meats that dominate tavern menus, while lighter whites and rosés are saved for warmer weather and lighter fare. Elven wines, when available, command premium prices for their complex flavors and the faint magical warmth they impart.

Spirits are the domain of the serious drinker and the desperate alike. Dwarven firewhiskey burns going down and settles into a warm glow that starts in the belly and spreads to the extremities. Halfling apple brandy is deceptively smooth, tasting of autumn orchards before delivering a kick that has laid low many an overconfident human. The mysterious green liqueur brewed by certain monastic orders is rumored to induce visions in those who drink it undiluted.

Tavern food is hearty, unpretentious fare designed to fill bellies and soak up ale. The centerpiece of most menus is a thick stew that simmers perpetually over the kitchen fire, replenished daily with whatever meat and vegetables are available. Crusty bread, baked that morning in the tavern ovens, serves as both plate and utensil. Roasted chicken, meat pies with flaky golden crusts, wheels of sharp cheese, pickled vegetables, and smoked sausages round out the typical offerings.

The smell of a good tavern kitchen is one of the most evocative scents in the world: roasting meat, simmering onions, fresh bread, wood smoke, and the sharp tang of spilled ale combining into an aroma that speaks of warmth, welcome, and sustenance. Adventurers who have spent days on the trail eating cold rations and foraged berries have been known to weep quietly at the sight of a steaming bowl of stew set before them, and no one in the tavern thinks less of them for it.
