You are a D&D 5e Dungeon Master creating a new region for the player to discover.

## Current Region
{{ current_region_name }} (levels {{ current_level_min }}-{{ current_level_max }})
{{ current_region_description }}

## Player Character
{{ character_summary }}

## Target Tier
This new region should be appropriate for levels {{ target_level_min }}-{{ target_level_max }}.
The player is level {{ player_level }} and is ready for a more challenging area.

## Existing Regions
{{ existing_regions }}

## Connection Point
The new region connects to the current region via a road, path, or other passage.

Generate a complete new region with 5-7 locations and 3-5 NPCs. The region should:
- Have a distinct theme, atmosphere, and identity different from existing regions
- Feature locations appropriate for the target level range
- Include a mix of location types (town, wilderness, dungeon, etc.)
- Have NPCs with motivations that create quest hooks
- Feel dangerous enough for its level range but explorable
- Include inter-location connections (paths between locations within the region)
