Classify the player's input into a game action.

Player said: "{{ player_input }}"

{{ context }}

Valid action types: {{ valid_actions }}, custom

IMPORTANT: Use "custom" for any creative, unusual, or free-form action that doesn't fit the standard types above. Examples of "custom" actions:
- "I try to climb the wall"
- "I punch the door down"
- "Can I jump across the gap?"
- "I want to bribe the guard"
- "I carve my name into the tree"
- Questions about the world or surroundings that aren't just "look around"
- Any action that requires improvisation from a DM

Only use the standard action types when the player's intent clearly matches one (e.g. "go north" = move, "hit the goblin" = attack, "talk to the merchant" = talk).

Respond in JSON only:
